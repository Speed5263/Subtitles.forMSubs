1
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,500
Is it raining?
Is it raining?

2
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,000
My brother

3
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,250
why don’t we change seats?

4
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,250
What do you want?

5
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,250
We’re on public transport, travelling by Qi-controlled sword!

6
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,750
If you don’t like squeezing in here, just go sword-riding yourself!

7
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,750
But, it’s not that crowded here…

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,250
I just like to sit like this

9
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,500
Come at me if you dare!

10
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,000
You… Hm!

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
People like you who take the sword,

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,750
I’m sure your Qi and internal forces mastering, if any, are quite embarrassingly bad

13
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,750
Dai Bo, there’s no need to, no need at all.! Don’t…

14
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,000
Just put away the weapon first…

15
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,750
We’re almost arriving at the interchange

16
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,750
Those who are going to get off the flying sword, pack your bags!

17
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,750
get ready *Ad Space for rent* *Final stop: Plum Blossom Villa*

18
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,000
This is a Skysword Interchange.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,500
Passengers who need to change swords,

20
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,250
please exit your sword.

21
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,000
For passengers who are in no need of a change of routes,

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,500
please wait on the sword

23
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,000
Line No. 4 is ready to depart.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,750
May passengers sit down and hold on steadily

25
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,750
So cold…

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That Plum Blossom Villa that you are going to…

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,500
is in northern Xuanwu

28
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,500
The region is high in altitude

29
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,250
It’s only natural for temperatures to lower as you go further north

30
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,250
Sir, can’t you start up the central heating?

31
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,750
Is there hot water there?

32
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,500
Give me some

33
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,250
It’s ok now

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,250
So many disparaging comments when you’re literally taking public transport

35
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,250
Two cents

36
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,500
And i will open up or a windshield.

37
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,500
Sure thing, sure!

38
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,500
About the windshield…

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,750
Woah… my body’s all warmed up now…

40
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,750
Thumbs-up Kung Fu guy, it’s you!

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What a coincidence,

42
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,000
didn’t expect to bump into you right here

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,250
It’s fate!

44
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,500
Eh? These injuries on your body, how did you-

45
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,000
It’s all because he saved you

46
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,750
He took damage from fighting that rock guy…

47
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,000
You must not have known about this… you were unconscious at that time

48
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,500
Just look at how he’s all bruised up and injured

49
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,750
He must have lost the fight

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It’s hard to say though…

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,250
Yeah, a loss, you shouldn’t put it that way…

52
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,750
He was chagrined by what you said

53
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,750
Turns out it’s all because he saved me

54
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,500
Dai Bo, act fast and take out the meds and give-

55
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
Let’s fight!

56
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,250
Huh? Did I hear wrong?

57
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,000
Us… are you talking about us? A fight between us?

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,750
You heard it right!

59
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,250
I want to fight you, one on one!

60
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,750
Let’s fight to the death on this very sword!

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
A battle between life and death

62
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,250
Even if I don’t quite understand…

63
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,250
But I’m in a rush to save someone

64
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,750
Why don’t you wait for me to finish saving her

65
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,250
And then we catch up later at some other place.

66
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,250
Right, you’re right!

67
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,500
I’ll prep some wine pairings by then, let’s catch up later

68
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,750
You Shadow Assassins have killed countless of people

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
how is it possible for a SHADOW ASSASSIN, of all people, to save lives?

70
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,250
From your Kung Fu…

71
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,000
It seemed like it… Are you the successor to the Thumbs-up Fist?

72
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,000
Your master died under his blade

73
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,750
You should be hating him

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,500
Go take your revenge on him…

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,500
but you’re so weak

76
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
It’s impossible for you to beat him,

77
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,000
It’s more than enough for you to let me see just how good you are at Thumbs up style

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Say, why don’t we make it like this:

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Let’s wait for the sword to stop

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Get off it and fight on the ground?

81
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,250
Someone is fighting on your sword!

82
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,000
Don’t you care at all?

83
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,750
Ha… It happens just about everyday

84
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,500
You guys fight all you want,

85
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
just don’t interfere with my sword control

86
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,250
Hey hey hey!

87
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,250
Don’t mess with my control,

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,500
don’t mess with it!

89
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,000
My hat, gimme back!

90
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,000
I’m finished!

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,500
Seven!

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,750
Stop with the fighting

93
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,750
We almost caused it to rollover

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,750
I dodge

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,500
I duck

96
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,750
Another dodge,

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,750
And another duck

98
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,500
You got to listen to my explanation first

99
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,250
Shadowless foot jab of Buddha’s Mountain!

100
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,000
My waist is almost broken…

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Here I come!

102
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,250
I saw that

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,750
Thumbs-up Kung Fu is a fighting style which attacks after your opponent strikes

104
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,250
If you don’t strike,

105
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,000
Then I can’t beat you

106
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,250
Once you start attacking me,

107
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,250
I will give you a thumbs up in return!

108
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,250
Isn’t that fantastic?

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,500
Six times seven equal 42 stances...

110
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,750
Thumbs-up!

111
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,750
There are two idiots fighting on the sword!

112
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,250
Really… These people think they have lived just way too long

113
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,500
When they fall, you probably can’t even find their corpse!

114
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,250
Let’s have a fight of thumb-ups!

115
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,750
Maybe this way, I can recover my lost memories

116
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
Three years ago

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,750
A Stanian appeared in Xuanwu,

118
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,000
our mission was to kill him.

119
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,250
But your master intervened and stopped it,

120
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
And helped out with his escapade

121
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,500
Your master's nothing but a traitor of Xuanwu

122
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,250
Even after I broke his bones,

123
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,750
he would not hand the guy over.

124
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,750
My master isn’t a Xuanwu traitor!

125
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,000
I will seek justice for him!

126
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,500
You’re too weak.

127
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,250
You can never avenge him

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,250
Driver, look out for the road!

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Please hold your attacks

130
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,500
We’re in due course for a collision into the mountain!

131
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:23,750
Ah… Hey hey hey hey

132
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,250
Don’t come over here!

133
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,500
Ah sh*t, we crashed

134
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,000
He was..

135
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Saving people?

136
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,750
Xia Fei, I thought you are injured?? Can you still fly?

137
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:38,009
*looney-tunes ahh fall*

138
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,500
You still want to fight?

139
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,500
My master said

140
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,500
You can look into one's heart

141
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,750
based on the way of his fist

142
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,750
Even if it’s the same fist fighting style,

143
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,250
It will feel different per person

144
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,500
It all hinges on the one using it

145
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,000
So while crossing fists,

146
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,250
You can have a rough impression of their character

147
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,750
So, just what kind of person

148
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,750
do you think I am?

149
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,250
You do not seem like a bad person

150
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,750
Me, however.

151
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,750
The Thumbs-up Fist I was using

152
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,750
was filled with hatred and anger

153
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,000
I was like a beast,

154
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,500
totally unbecoming of the Thumbs-up Fist.

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,250
If my master saw how I was just now,

156
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,500
he must have been really disappointed in me

157
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,750
I still could not recall

158
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,750
the everything that had happened

159
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,250
But based on the little memories I retained,

160
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,500
I have to admit, I definitely crossed fists with your Master

161
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,500
What?

162
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,750
Are you dying to ask

163
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,500
what could possibly be the reason I told you all these

164
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,000
It’s all because

165
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,000
I wanted more people to know the notions of the Thumb-up Fist

166
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,250
In the future, before any of you want to strike first,

167
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,500
you would think it through a little

168
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,250
When my enemy doesn’t strike me,

169
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,500
neither will I

170
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,250
This world,

171
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,750
will have lesser conflict!

172
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,500
Oh, and,

173
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,750
He’s really an amazing Martial Artist.

174
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,250
I promise you

175
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,750
Once everything is over,

176
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,250
I will come back and look for you

177
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,500
Of course!

178
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,000
we have not decide a winner on

179
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,500
just who has the better Thumbs-up Fist?

180
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,000
Next time, why don’t we compete in our hairstyling skills?

181
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,250
hahahaha

182
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,250
Even at the cost of your life, you would still protect that Stanian.

183
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,000
…unless, in actuality, you're a spy?

184
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,250
Not everyone from Stan is a bad person,

185
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,000
either way, people from Xuanwu are not all saints

186
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,750
Thumbs-up Fist,

187
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,658
Advocates for the love for life

188
00:11:53,033 --> 00:11:54,033
and cherish sentience

189
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,250
regardless of borders,

190
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,250
Regardless of race

191
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,500
Whenever I see someone who is in need of help,

192
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,500
I will definitely lend a hand

193
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,500
Such good weather

194
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,250
Waiting… will tomorrow be a sunny day?

195
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,000
Waiting for yesterday, I’m no longer afraid of those memories

196
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,000
I miss u

197
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:06,000
Scattered with dark emotions

198
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,750
The you in my memories

199
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,750
Decided to go on a trip on your own

200
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,750
Insisted on going on the trip alone
decided to go on a trip on your own

201
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,000
Meet

202
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,000
It’s not even in summer

203
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,250
Good weather where the sun shines through…

204
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,250
like we’re destined to part ways

205
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:32,750
The “you” I’m missing

206
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:37,000
full of the warmth of positive emotions

207
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,250
The “you” I’m missing

208
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,500
Wishes that you will end your travels

209
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,750
Let’s meet again

210
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,500
even if the weather is bad

211
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,750
and we don’t need to fuss over things again…

212
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,250
Who needs to separate from each other? :D
