1
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,750
I’m already out of time.

2
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,250
In the north of Xuanwu,

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,750
there’s still one man

4
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,500
who can teach you.

5
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,000
Master,

6
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,250
I still can’t do it.

7
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,500
Interesting…

8
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,750
It’s been seven years…

9
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,500
Is this it?

10
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,250
Not bad.

11
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,500
But you got your practising all wrong. Double the effort for half of the result.

12
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,250
Let’s go home.

13
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,500
Miss Mei!

14
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,750
That ought to be her father!

15
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,250
Hello, uncle!

16
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,500
My name is Wu Liuqi.

17
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,250
This chicken and these fruits

18
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,250
are my, uh,

19
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,250
… Just a little something for you!

20
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,250
I didn’t want to appear disrespectful.

21
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,250
Is he your friend?

22
00:05:59,250 --> 00:05:59,750
…No.

23
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,250
Given your disposition,

24
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,750
there’s only two reasons for you to be looking for me.

25
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
First, to challenge me.

26
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Second, to ask a favour of me.

27
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,500
From the looks of your motioning so far,

28
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,000
it would be the latter.

29
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,750
This was my last resort.

30
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,750
You used two different sword styles today.

31
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,250
Akimbo Flow champions flow in strength and excels in its ferocity.

32
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,500
Qingyun Style: Its moves doesn't betray its namesake, Flowing Clouds and Water.
It is the very embodiment of natural, unrestrained flowing svelte.

33
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,750
But all you’ve got is a mere imitation of them.

34
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,250
You haven’t grasped their essentials—

35
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,750
as if you were only taught of it recently.

36
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,500
Try piercing the boulder in front of you.

37
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,500
Now, look at the ground.

38
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,500
Every time you make a move,

39
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,000
you expel precious Qi everywhere.

40
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,500
At first thought, it seems like an impressive show of might.

41
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,000
However, it is in fact indicative of one’s lack of control over Qi.

42
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,250
In a duel between swordmasters of the best of the best,

43
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
that would be your fatal flaw.

44
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
And as for this newly learned sword style of yours,

45
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,000
the most vital part is

46
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,250
the “how” in terms of controlling your Qi.

47
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,000
only use it for dealing a fatal strike.

48
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,750
And in an instant,

49
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,500
all of it can be released.

50
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,750
Before releasing it,

51
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,750
your body should be as calm as the surface of water.

52
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,750
But within your body

53
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,250
there lies a huge amount of energy.

54
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,500
Owner!

55
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,000
There’s a very terse situation.

56
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,500
Owner,

57
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,250
I saw some assassins lying in ambush outside.

58
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,000
I think they’re here because of that girl.

59
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,250
Should I…

60
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,250
Just look after the young lord, it’s enough.

61
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,750
Mere assassins…

62
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,750
They’re not worth my attention.

63
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,000
Thank you.

64
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,000
My matters,

65
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I’ll deal with them myself.
(My life my rules ahh)

66
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
You have to stay alive a little longer.

67
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,500
I still need to come back to properly challenge you.
