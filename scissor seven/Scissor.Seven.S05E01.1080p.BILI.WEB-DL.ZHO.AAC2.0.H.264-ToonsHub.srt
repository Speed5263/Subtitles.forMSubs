1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,543
Heard you were looking for me

2
00:00:01,787 --> 00:00:04,875
Come to Chicken Island for more info!!!

3
00:00:31,496 --> 00:00:35,413
Seven's special mission: 1

4
00:00:53,816 --> 00:00:54,616
Have you

5
00:00:54,616 --> 00:00:56,296
seen that helmet-shaped spaceship?

6
00:00:57,868 --> 00:00:58,993
Your mission...

7
00:00:59,009 --> 00:00:59,949
is to find a way to sneak inside that thing,

8
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:02,542
find that door,

9
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,522
and rescue the guys trapped inside it

10
00:01:14,618 --> 00:01:15,612
What about the key?

11
00:01:16,907 --> 00:01:18,199
It's also inside,

12
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:19,532
you need to go find it yourself

13
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:21,948
Are we going to the mission together?

14
00:01:25,656 --> 00:01:26,531
Wear this,

15
00:01:26,864 --> 00:01:29,114
then I can see what you see

16
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:30,822
I'm better off staying,

17
00:01:30,822 --> 00:01:32,156
giving you orders here

18
00:01:39,446 --> 00:01:41,446
Then shouldn't there also be a hi-tech plane

19
00:01:41,446 --> 00:01:42,862
that take both of us to the spaceship?

20
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,233
Actually, we can use explosives or something...

21
00:02:17,316 --> 00:02:19,441
Why not just bomb the hell out of that thing?

22
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:24,357
The shockwaves will make this entire thing implode.

23
00:02:24,482 --> 00:02:26,940
By that time, Chicken Island will be no more

24
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,913
Just stick to the plan...

25
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,125
Don't sweat it,

26
00:02:38,563 --> 00:02:40,313
I did say I would protect you from harm...

27
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:20,125
I was lucky,

28
00:03:20,341 --> 00:03:22,041
and thanks for nothing for your "protection"

29
00:03:26,182 --> 00:03:28,890
Your age: ???

30
00:03:29,057 --> 00:03:30,875
This question... it's a bit difficult...

31
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:32,640
Your age,

32
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:34,001
you don't even know it yourself?

33
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,014
Anything that happened over 2 years ago...

34
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:37,056
I can't remember...

35
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:41,222
According to my calculations...

36
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,222
say, 30?

37
00:04:04,927 --> 00:04:06,750
Eh... maybe some people just don't age as well...

38
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:09,093
Lemme guess... You're actually an 18 years old kid

39
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:18,509
*loud incorrect buzzer*

40
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:24,425
It must be 20

41
00:04:29,841 --> 00:04:30,799
25!

42
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:34,059
28...

43
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:34,953
27

44
00:04:35,313 --> 00:04:35,760
24

45
00:04:36,346 --> 00:04:36,839
12

46
00:04:37,423 --> 00:04:37,813
40

47
00:04:38,186 --> 00:04:38,793
21

48
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,253
This will be the last time I trust you...

49
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,005
If there's one more time of this...

50
00:04:47,422 --> 00:04:49,000
It opened

51
00:04:56,837 --> 00:04:57,837
Don't open

52
00:04:57,837 --> 00:04:59,142
The door's at the end of this corridor,

53
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:10,627
Same shit... It's those Infra-Red whatever, useless traps all over again

54
00:05:10,808 --> 00:05:12,002
Not a problem for me, and never will!

55
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,903
I'M SPEED

56
00:05:33,104 --> 00:05:33,917
What a save!

57
00:05:34,957 --> 00:05:36,415
Guess I really didn't expect that...

58
00:05:43,097 --> 00:05:44,289
Again?!

59
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:50,247
Likes eating: BEEF OFFAL

60
00:05:55,163 --> 00:05:56,246
Calling: Cheap Life Hua

61
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:57,454
How do you even pass this level?

62
00:05:57,454 --> 00:05:59,204
I saw all that

63
00:05:59,246 --> 00:06:00,204
This door

64
00:06:00,204 --> 00:06:02,250
isn't the one at the end of the corridor

65
00:06:02,537 --> 00:06:04,037
it's actually THAT one...

66
00:06:04,037 --> 00:06:06,037
the one with a lid...

67
00:06:06,037 --> 00:06:07,870
Just open the lid

68
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,870
and you get to enter the next level

69
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,369
And you...

70
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:12,869
Just speed over there as quick as you can,

71
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:15,244
go press the start button on the wall...

72
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:17,243
and the lasers will stop shooting you

73
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:23,868
There's poisonous gas

74
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,450
I can't open it...

75
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:36,033
Isn't this Klotski?

76
00:06:37,657 --> 00:06:39,483
That woman...

77
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,574
move her to the square at the bottom,

78
00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:44,073
only then will the door open itself

79
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:56,030
Isn't this way too hard

80
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:58,338
Left

81
00:06:58,718 --> 00:06:59,765
Right.
Right

82
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:00,817
Push, push down

83
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:02,208
Not this one

84
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,124
Yeah, this one

85
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:04,862
Now push up

86
00:07:05,311 --> 00:07:06,862
Move that one in the right to the left

87
00:07:40,858 --> 00:07:42,076
Did I forgot to...

88
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,831
cover my nose and mouth?

89
00:07:51,856 --> 00:07:52,999
I can't take it anymore...

90
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:55,856
I got poisoned...

91
00:07:55,856 --> 00:07:57,439
hey hey hey don't sleep

92
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,439
you're literally one step away,

93
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,479
just push it down

94
00:08:19,664 --> 00:08:21,484
Cheap life Hua? It's over...

95
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,077
Is this... like a fridge?

96
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,604
According to the previous patterns...

97
00:08:36,604 --> 00:08:38,819
This should lead me to the next level...

98
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:48,977
And... I can't open it.

99
00:08:49,977 --> 00:08:51,641
Let me go check if there's other doors here...

100
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,750
Weird. Looks like there's a dog in the icicle...

101
00:09:23,348 --> 00:09:24,389
Woah. There's a female dog right there

102
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,178
The hairdresser's new mission:

103
00:09:47,178 --> 00:09:48,470
Pet grooming!

104
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:59,002
Um... I guess it's actually "Pet and frisbee" now...

105
00:10:03,376 --> 00:10:05,468
Maybe I can use some help from it to access the next level...

106
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:10,967
Hi~

107
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:12,141
You stupid dog~

108
00:10:19,174 --> 00:10:19,966
You come at me

109
00:10:19,966 --> 00:10:20,966
Come over here

110
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:43,208
NO WAY IT'S THE BRIDGE

111
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:48,067
Why... why does this all seem so familiar?

112
00:11:35,997 --> 00:11:36,831
This

113
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,708
This is...

114
00:11:54,328 --> 00:11:57,078
Do you know why this door is locked?

115
00:11:58,665 --> 00:12:00,828
Are you sure you want to open it?

116
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:32,823
Eh... I told you I will shield you

117
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,208
You should have made the move way earlier,

118
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,583
when you literally are the powerful guy...

119
00:12:36,512 --> 00:12:37,625
It doesn't work that way

120
00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:39,819
My Kung Fu can't harm him.

121
00:12:40,822 --> 00:12:41,926
To defeat him once and for all,

122
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:43,750
you ultimately need to rely on yourself

123
00:12:44,287 --> 00:12:45,625
What even is this thing?

124
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,405
Don't sweat those details

125
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,403
Direct your focus on it, no hesitations!

126
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,819
My pair of scissors can't even damage him

127
00:13:11,402 --> 00:13:12,078
I need to use his sword!

128
00:13:40,815 --> 00:13:42,192
Cheap life Hua!!!

129
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:06,978
If you forget the EVERYTHING of the past

130
00:14:07,478 --> 00:14:10,811
Perchance you can start off a new life on a clean slate

131
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:16,977
Go draw a clear cut boundary from your past

132
00:14:18,393 --> 00:14:19,810
Open the door

133
00:14:20,185 --> 00:14:23,675
and you will plunge yourself straight back into the bottomless pit of darkness,

134
00:14:24,635 --> 00:14:26,542
until death seperates you from it

135
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:44,292
Don't go back on yourself, when you've already decided your fate

136
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,014
That really tired me out...

137
00:16:05,588 --> 00:16:07,629
I feel like dried Ginseng

138
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:26,125
Come and have your meds

139
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,797
But I'm naked...

140
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:34,833
I'm not sure if viewers want to see me in my bday suit...

141
00:16:34,834 --> 00:16:35,530
Clothes are over there

142
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,100
Nice herbal soup

143
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,827
He always sported a nonchalant look

144
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:24,708
Not much of a looker, he doesn't seem to have any abilities

145
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:25,920
He doesn't say much either

146
00:17:25,994 --> 00:17:27,667
about big truths

147
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,827
But sometimes, just sometimes, he seems unusually obstinated

148
00:17:30,827 --> 00:17:32,993
The past that can't be removed

149
00:17:33,689 --> 00:17:36,826
it's all for moral's sake, he protects those things that's valued most to him

150
00:17:36,826 --> 00:17:37,826
Close your eyes

151
00:17:37,826 --> 00:17:39,409
Concentrate

152
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:40,200
Leave anytime

153
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,492
Leave immediately

154
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:43,492
Don't hesitate even if it's only you that's headed for it
