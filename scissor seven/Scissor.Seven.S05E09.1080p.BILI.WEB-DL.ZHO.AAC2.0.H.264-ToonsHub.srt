00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:35,451
Mission 9: The Eyeless Sorcerer’s premonition

2
00:00:37,272 --> 00:00:39,272
Hey, Mr. know-all, you know a lot of things right?

3
00:00:40,022 --> 00:00:40,772
Have you heard,

4
00:00:40,772 --> 00:00:42,272
Just recently in the ranks of Shadow Assassins,

5
00:00:42,272 --> 00:00:43,272
There emerged

6
00:00:43,522 --> 00:00:44,522
someone called

7
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:45,772
Green something bird?

8
00:00:46,522 --> 00:00:47,522
Yeah, I’ve heard

9
00:00:47,772 --> 00:00:49,522
Dual Sword Green Phoenix, right?

10
00:00:49,772 --> 00:00:51,772
He had his limbs all broken,

11
00:00:51,772 --> 00:00:53,022
And was brought to hang in Crocodile Valley.

12
00:00:53,522 --> 00:00:54,272
Ya know,

13
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,022
Why don’t they just straight up kill him?

14
00:00:57,772 --> 00:00:59,522
You asked “Mr. know-all”, he delivers!

15
00:01:00,022 --> 00:01:00,772
This move,

16
00:01:01,022 --> 00:01:02,272
Is called “Luring the snake out of its hole”.

17
00:01:02,522 --> 00:01:04,022
Take a look at that girl on that wanted poster.

18
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,522
That’s Green Phoenix’s apprentice.

19
00:01:05,772 --> 00:01:07,272
With her master being tortured like this,

20
00:01:07,272 --> 00:01:08,772
You just wait and see! They’re testing to see if she’ll come save him.

21
00:01:09,772 --> 00:01:11,022
Is that girl really powerful?

22
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:12,272
Well ya know, I heard

23
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:14,522
her master taught her a sword style of his epitome.

24
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:15,522
As for that style,

25
00:01:16,522 --> 00:01:19,022
If you wanna know what it is, it’ll be paid content for the details below…

26
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:20,022
wanna hear it?

27
00:01:20,272 --> 00:01:21,772
At the bare minimum, give me some of that *money money* for my awesome storytelling efforts…

28
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,522
At least she’s still alive,

29
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:28,522
you even got to see her in the flesh.

30
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:30,022
You no longer need to worry.

31
00:01:30,272 --> 00:01:31,022
Waiter!

32
00:01:31,272 --> 00:01:32,272
Gimme your best wine!

33
00:01:33,022 --> 00:01:33,772
Okay!

34
00:01:34,022 --> 00:01:35,272
Sir, you spend generously!

35
00:01:36,272 --> 00:01:37,772
How come it’s this waiter again?

36
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:39,522
Did you swap jobs?

37
00:01:39,522 --> 00:01:40,522
Look around you.

38
00:01:42,272 --> 00:01:46,022
You guys decorated this restaurant exactly the same as before?

39
00:01:47,272 --> 00:01:49,272
It’s you who came back to this restaurant!!!

40
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:53,882
Man of the thousand kilo axes!

41
00:01:54,465 --> 00:01:55,757
Steely claws | white clouds

42
00:01:55,772 --> 00:01:56,522
Again?!

43
00:01:57,022 --> 00:01:57,522
What do we do?

44
00:01:58,022 --> 00:01:58,522
Calm down.

45
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:00,772
Gaiba Egg!

46
00:02:04,522 --> 00:02:05,772
Sorrowful Magic Melody!

47
00:02:09,272 --> 00:02:13,772
In mY hEaRt, YoU’rE tHe OnLy oNe

48
00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:18,522
You stole my heart, but I didn’t dare tell you

49
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,022
Since then, I’ve been daydr—

50
00:02:20,022 --> 00:02:22,272
He can’t use Sorrowful Magic Melody at all!
Since then, I’ve been daydr—

51
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:23,272
Crap!

52
00:02:23,772 --> 00:02:24,522
Let’s go!

53
00:02:29,522 --> 00:02:30,772
He ran away again!

54
00:02:31,272 --> 00:02:32,022
Chase them separately!

55
00:02:33,877 --> 00:02:34,377
Geometry Dash ahh 😭🙏

56
00:03:18,522 --> 00:03:19,772
Still in the mood to look at flowers?

57
00:03:20,022 --> 00:03:22,022
Any later and everyone will be gone!

58
00:03:24,272 --> 00:03:24,772
Hey!

59
00:03:25,022 --> 00:03:26,022
Where are you going, Seven?!

60
00:03:31,522 --> 00:03:32,022
This…

61
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:01,772
What’s so interesting about a graveyard?

62
00:04:05,272 --> 00:04:06,272
Those buried here,

63
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:09,022
all sacrificed their lives for Xuanwu.

64
00:04:10,522 --> 00:04:11,772
This time, every year,

65
00:04:12,772 --> 00:04:14,272
I always return here to pay my respects.
(Note: Monks typically recite / chant sutras to supposedly act as guidance for the deceased’s journey to Sukhavati)

66
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:20,522
Last time, when I was in front of the Divine Eagle statue,

67
00:04:20,522 --> 00:04:21,522
if I were to be killed by you, then…

68
00:04:22,272 --> 00:04:23,772
Would I also be buried here?

69
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:25,522
Indeed.

70
00:04:26,772 --> 00:04:29,272
In fact, you should have been buried here two years ago.

71
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,022
Seven, this…

72
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:35,522
Dai Bo, this time, don’t stop me.

73
00:04:36,022 --> 00:04:37,522
This man is very dangerous.

74
00:04:39,272 --> 00:04:40,022
Do you remember?

75
00:04:40,272 --> 00:04:42,272
Two years ago, we also met here.

76
00:04:45,522 --> 00:04:47,772
You were trying to save a girl back then, too.

77
00:04:58,272 --> 00:04:59,272
What is this?

78
00:05:01,272 --> 00:05:01,772
Seven!

79
00:05:03,022 --> 00:05:05,522
Seems like you don’t remember everything quite yet.

80
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:14,272
No rush.

81
00:05:15,272 --> 00:05:17,022
Let me first tell you a story.

82
00:05:24,522 --> 00:05:25,522
Xuanwu:

83
00:05:26,772 --> 00:05:28,522
a country that exalts martial arts,

84
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:32,022
fears that science and technology would eventually replace everything.

85
00:05:33,272 --> 00:05:35,272
So they declared Stan their enemy.

86
00:05:36,772 --> 00:05:38,522
An assassin training program was brought into existence.

87
00:05:41,272 --> 00:05:43,522
They hoped that those who passed would kill Stanian scientists,

88
00:05:44,022 --> 00:05:45,522
in order to halt their technological progress.

89
00:05:47,522 --> 00:05:48,272
Six years ago,

90
00:05:49,272 --> 00:05:51,772
The program created the perfect assassin.

91
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:54,522
Unrivaled upon this earth,

92
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,522
unstoppable by anyone.

93
00:05:59,522 --> 00:06:01,772
But as he completed more and more missions,

94
00:06:02,772 --> 00:06:04,522
He started to formulate his own sense of conscience.

95
00:06:05,772 --> 00:06:07,772
He began to disobey the leader’s orders,

96
00:06:10,522 --> 00:06:11,522
which made the leader furious.

97
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:13,772
Disobedient pawns

98
00:06:14,522 --> 00:06:16,022
made him feel quite unsafe.

99
00:06:17,272 --> 00:06:19,022
A plan was drafted to eliminate the rogue assassin.

100
00:06:20,272 --> 00:06:21,022
But who

101
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:24,022
could assassinate the world’s greatest assassin?

102
00:06:26,772 --> 00:06:28,522
Everyone has a weakness.

103
00:06:30,772 --> 00:06:32,522
This unrivaled, unstoppable assassin

104
00:06:33,272 --> 00:06:35,022
Turns out to be susceptible to feelings about girls. (or: maidens? women? ladies?)

105
00:06:39,522 --> 00:06:41,272
Thus, the leader drafted a plan.

106
00:06:42,522 --> 00:06:43,522
He had this young girl

107
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:45,022
locked up in the Tower of the Mystical Beast.

108
00:06:50,022 --> 00:06:51,022
The assassin wanted to save the girl,

109
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:53,022
but must kill the beast first.

110
00:06:54,272 --> 00:06:56,022
If the beast is slain by him,

111
00:06:56,522 --> 00:06:57,522
then, this assassin

112
00:06:58,022 --> 00:07:00,272
would become “Public Enemy No. 1” to the entirety of Xuanwu.

113
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:19,022
Though he was burdened by the injured girl,

114
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,772
After waves and waves of encircling attacks,

115
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:24,772
Still, no one managed to take him down.

116
00:07:34,022 --> 00:07:35,022
At a critical moment,

117
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,022
The girl took out a dagger coated with a strangely toxic poison

118
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:41,272
And stabbed the assassin right in the back.

119
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:49,522
The assassin used the remainder of his strength to destroy the bridge.

120
00:07:50,272 --> 00:07:51,022
He fell into the river,

121
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:53,522
disappearing without a trace.

122
00:07:56,272 --> 00:07:56,772
As for the girl,

123
00:07:57,772 --> 00:07:59,772
She was intended to be used to kill the assassin from the very beginning.

124
00:08:03,522 --> 00:08:05,022
and their meeting

125
00:08:06,272 --> 00:08:08,022
was all planned from the very start.

126
00:08:11,522 --> 00:08:13,772
You were designed to protect this country.

127
00:08:14,272 --> 00:08:16,272
Nothing but a killing machine created at the hands of someone.

128
00:08:17,022 --> 00:08:18,272
Once used up, you would be disposed of.

129
00:08:20,022 --> 00:08:21,272
Then, there will be another assassin

130
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:22,522
to take your place.

131
00:08:24,022 --> 00:08:25,772
The feelings that you experience…

132
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,522
are all ingenuine.

133
00:08:30,272 --> 00:08:31,522
It was designed to destroy you…

134
00:08:32,022 --> 00:08:33,522
from the very beginning of the script.

135
00:08:35,772 --> 00:08:36,272
So…

136
00:08:37,772 --> 00:08:39,272
You should hate these people.

137
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:42,272
You should be here for revenge.

138
00:08:43,772 --> 00:08:44,522
And then

139
00:08:44,772 --> 00:08:47,272
You will become others’ target as well, for revenge.

140
00:08:52,272 --> 00:08:53,022
This is…

141
00:08:54,022 --> 00:08:55,772
the fate of all Shadow Killers.

142
00:08:58,772 --> 00:08:59,522
Seven!

143
00:09:59,022 --> 00:09:59,522
Thank you.

144
00:10:00,272 --> 00:10:01,522
For giving me a fresh start,

145
00:10:01,522 --> 00:10:03,272
and another chance at life.

146
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:10,022
Although I’ve returned here again,

147
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:11,272
But,

148
00:10:12,522 --> 00:10:13,522
I’m different from who I was before.

149
00:10:34,522 --> 00:10:36,022
All my predictions were wrong.

150
00:10:39,522 --> 00:10:40,022
In my calculations,

151
00:10:41,772 --> 00:10:43,022
after you discovered the truth,

152
00:10:43,772 --> 00:10:45,272
You should have become the shadow of revenge.

153
00:10:46,022 --> 00:10:48,022
Vowing to kill everyone who deceived you.

154
00:10:52,022 --> 00:10:53,772
Then I would have used all of my strength

155
00:10:54,522 --> 00:10:55,772
to bury you here.

156
00:10:58,272 --> 00:10:58,772
Ha!

157
00:10:58,772 --> 00:10:59,772
You and your calculations were all wrong!

158
00:11:00,522 --> 00:11:01,772
Fortune tellers who have these wildly inaccurate projections…

159
00:11:01,772 --> 00:11:03,022
should issue refunds!

160
00:11:04,772 --> 00:11:05,772
Everything’s different.

161
00:11:09,772 --> 00:11:12,022
Great master, have you ever left Xuanwu to visit other places?

162
00:11:15,522 --> 00:11:17,772
I was young then, but already I was appointed Imperial Preceptor.

163
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:21,022
In order to protect Xuanwu’s destiny,

164
00:11:22,522 --> 00:11:23,272
I must foresee any possible dangers,

165
00:11:24,022 --> 00:11:25,022
solve disasters,

166
00:11:26,522 --> 00:11:28,522
I’ve never been half a step further away from Xuanwu.

167
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:31,772
If you’ve got time, come to Chicken Island!

168
00:11:32,522 --> 00:11:33,272
I can cut your ha—

169
00:11:34,022 --> 00:11:34,522
I mean,

170
00:11:35,272 --> 00:11:36,272
let me treat you to some beef offal!

171
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:37,522
Perhaps,

172
00:11:38,022 --> 00:11:39,022
It could help give you a different perspective

173
00:11:39,022 --> 00:11:40,022
of this world.

174
00:11:42,772 --> 00:11:43,522
Until we meet again, if fate allows!

175
00:12:04,772 --> 00:12:05,772
Seven, you…

176
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:08,022
Do you really not hate any of those people who wanted to hurt you?

177
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:11,772
I feel that the story master just told me,

178
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,022
wasn’t entirely the truth.

179
00:12:15,022 --> 00:12:15,772
The miracle doctor said,

180
00:12:16,022 --> 00:12:17,272
The dagger that was stabbed into me in the back,

181
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:20,022
Was veneered with a poison that causes memory losses.

182
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:21,522
So, I think,

183
00:12:22,272 --> 00:12:23,272
that girl,

184
00:12:23,272 --> 00:12:25,272
should’ve wanted me to forget all of the hatred here,

185
00:12:25,772 --> 00:12:27,272
In order to give me a fresh start in life.

186
00:12:50,772 --> 00:12:53,022
Waiting for good weather to come out

187
00:12:54,339 --> 00:13:05,545
Waiting… will tomorrow be a sunny day?

188
00:13:06,462 --> 00:13:13,045
Waiting for good weather

189
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:19,772
Waiting for yesterday, I’m no longer afraid of those memories

190
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:22,772
I miss u

191
00:13:23,022 --> 00:13:25,522
Scattered with dark emotions

192
00:13:25,522 --> 00:13:27,772
scattered with the two-tone grays of your emotions

193
00:13:28,022 --> 00:13:30,772
The you in my memories

194
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:35,875
Decided to go on a trip on your own

195
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:39,022
Meet

196
00:13:39,522 --> 00:13:41,522
It’s not even in summer

197
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:46,272
Good weather where the sun shines through…

198
00:13:46,522 --> 00:13:50,873
like we’re destined to part ways

199
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,039
The "you" I'm fond of

200
00:13:54,772 --> 00:13:59,022
full of the warmth of positive emotions

201
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:02,272
The “you” I’m missing

202
00:14:02,522 --> 00:14:07,522
Wishes that you will end your travels

203
00:14:07,772 --> 00:14:09,522
Let’s meet again

204
00:14:09,522 --> 00:14:13,522
even if the weather is bad

205
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:17,772
and we don’t need to fuss over things again…

206
00:14:17,772 --> 00:14:22,272
Who needs to separate from each other? :D
