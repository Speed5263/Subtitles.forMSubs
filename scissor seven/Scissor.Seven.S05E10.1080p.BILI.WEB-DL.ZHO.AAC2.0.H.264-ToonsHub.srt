00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:34,465
Mission 10: The Battle of Black Rock Mountain

3
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:22,937
Not bad, guys.

4
00:02:24,437 --> 00:02:25,687
Heh, it’s nothing.

5
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:29,187
After all, I’m the best netmaker in the world!

6
00:02:31,687 --> 00:02:32,687
Your master’s sword

7
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:33,937
almost killed me.

8
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:36,687
Then, let’s take your pretty little face

9
00:02:36,687 --> 00:02:37,687
to pay it back.

10
00:02:38,187 --> 00:02:38,687
Argh, my goodness!

11
00:02:39,187 --> 00:02:39,937
Isn’t this face beautiful?

12
00:02:43,687 --> 00:02:44,937
Seven, catch!

13
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:53,187
I can’t give you this pretty face.

14
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:54,687
But let me gift you a new haircut instead!

15
00:02:56,437 --> 00:02:57,687
Kill that fat chicken first!

16
00:02:59,687 --> 00:03:01,437
Flashbang Gaiba Egg!

17
00:03:03,187 --> 00:03:04,937
MY EYES!!

18
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:08,437
I cut!

19
00:03:13,437 --> 00:03:15,187
Compared to that housekeeper who plays with his ropes,

20
00:03:15,187 --> 00:03:16,187
your skills are far from him.

21
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:16,937
Go,

22
00:03:17,187 --> 00:03:18,437
I already remember your appearance

23
00:03:18,937 --> 00:03:19,937
Go back and get plastic surgery

24
00:03:20,687 --> 00:03:22,687
We’ve seen through this trap long ago

25
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,687
We really are worthy of the title:

26
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:25,937
The strongest duo!

27
00:03:28,437 --> 00:03:28,937
No,

28
00:03:29,187 --> 00:03:30,187
We’re Los Pollos, the man-chicken duo!

29
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:32,187
What ugly thing is this? (shit’s so ugly my eyes could bleed brah🤗)

30
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:33,937
Sorry, excuse me,

31
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:35,437
let me go change first.

32
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:40,687
This outfit is definitely more comfortable.

33
00:03:43,687 --> 00:03:44,937
How’d you get over here?

34
00:03:46,187 --> 00:03:47,937
Cutting off my hair,

35
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:48,937
is a death sentence.

36
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,687
But your opponent today isn’t me.

37
00:03:52,187 --> 00:03:53,187
Rather…

38
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:00,437
Wat’s this?

39
00:04:03,437 --> 00:04:04,187
Stone Gate,

40
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:06,937
is Black Rock Mountain’s strongest fighter.

41
00:04:08,437 --> 00:04:09,687
So it’s him!

42
00:04:09,937 --> 00:04:10,437
Wat?

43
00:04:10,937 --> 00:04:12,187
Why say that, brother?

44
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:12,937
The legend goes,

45
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:14,437
In Black Rock Mountain, there’s someone

46
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,187
who can control stones since he was a child.

47
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:18,187
And stones from Black Rock Mountain…

48
00:04:18,187 --> 00:04:20,187
are the hardest stones in the world!

49
00:04:20,937 --> 00:04:21,687
So,

50
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:23,187
no one has ever

51
00:04:23,187 --> 00:04:25,687
been able to defeat this stone-manipulating man.

52
00:04:27,437 --> 00:04:28,187
No wonder that

53
00:04:28,187 --> 00:04:30,437
you guys set up a trap here.

54
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:31,937
Where’d he go?

55
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:36,687
My injury still hasn’t healed yet.

56
00:04:36,937 --> 00:04:38,187
You two have fun.

57
00:04:53,437 --> 00:04:53,937
Dai Bo!

58
00:04:55,937 --> 00:04:57,437
Remember, 1 minute tops!

59
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:00,437
More than enough!

60
00:05:23,437 --> 00:05:23,937
x

61
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,437
Find the right gap!

62
00:05:46,187 --> 00:05:47,187
Qi Controlled Scissors!

63
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:55,437
He’s the one they call “The World’s Greatest Assassin”

64
00:05:56,187 --> 00:05:56,937
Codename: Seven?

65
00:05:57,937 --> 00:05:59,187
Stone Gate chose a

66
00:05:59,187 --> 00:06:00,437
Very reserved strategy to fight.

67
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:01,937
He’s stopping him from using the Thousand Demon Dagger.

68
00:06:02,937 --> 00:06:03,687
Boring.

69
00:06:05,437 --> 00:06:06,937
as long as I can get it to spin fast enough,

70
00:06:06,937 --> 00:06:08,437
I can cut through this rock.

71
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:39,937
*I* will kill him.

72
00:06:49,937 --> 00:06:51,437
I don’t like him

73
00:06:52,437 --> 00:06:53,437
I don’t like him either;

74
00:06:53,687 --> 00:06:56,437
but as long as the mission is complete, its fine.

75
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:03,187
His sword can easily cut through the stones of Black Rock Mountain.

76
00:07:04,187 --> 00:07:05,187
It’s gotta be extremely sharp, nothing like it.

77
00:07:22,937 --> 00:07:24,187
One shot will blow your head off!

78
00:07:24,187 --> 00:07:24,937
Surprise attack!

79
00:07:42,187 --> 00:07:43,687
You move like a snail!

80
00:07:58,187 --> 00:07:59,437
And neither is your strength worth any mention.

81
00:08:14,687 --> 00:08:15,687
Thousand Demon Dagger?

82
00:08:16,687 --> 00:08:17,437
Now, that’s interesting.

83
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,687
I somehow got out of that one.

84
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:25,937
In addition to speed

85
00:08:25,937 --> 00:08:26,687
and power,

86
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:29,937
I have an arsenal of different fighting techniques.

87
00:08:34,187 --> 00:08:34,687
Tch!

88
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:51,937
They say…

89
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:53,687
You and I

90
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:55,187
share the same source of power.

91
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:57,187
So,

92
00:08:57,187 --> 00:08:59,187
I should be able to use this too.

93
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:08,187
He’s too strong.

94
00:09:08,937 --> 00:09:10,187
How am I going to beat him?

95
00:09:12,187 --> 00:09:13,687
Let me show you

96
00:09:14,437 --> 00:09:16,187
how to really handle the Thousand Demon Dagger.

97
00:09:37,187 --> 00:09:39,187
Oh, this is so fun!

98
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,187
Waaaay too weak!

99
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:51,187
He’s much worse than he was two years ago.

100
00:09:51,187 --> 00:09:52,187
You’ve become weaker.
He’s much worse than he was two years ago.

101
00:09:52,187 --> 00:09:53,437
Also,
So much weaker than before…

102
00:09:53,437 --> 00:09:54,187
That’s not even how you use the Demon Dagger

103
00:09:54,937 --> 00:09:56,187
They all say

104
00:09:56,187 --> 00:09:57,187
Past me was really strong.

105
00:09:58,937 --> 00:09:59,937
Can it be… all that I need to do…

106
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:02,187
is to put all the pieces of my old self back together?

107
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:03,687
would I be able to beat him then?

108
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:06,437
But

109
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:07,687
there’s still a part of me

110
00:10:08,187 --> 00:10:08,937
that I just couldn’t reassemble.

111
00:10:10,187 --> 00:10:11,687
Just how am I supposed to

112
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:12,687
get it right?

113
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:26,937
You’re solving it wrong.

114
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:31,687
The color here obviously doesn’t match up at all.

115
00:10:32,437 --> 00:10:33,437
Why not this way?

116
00:10:33,937 --> 00:10:35,687
It looks good put together this way too.

117
00:10:35,937 --> 00:10:37,687
There’s more than one way to solve it.

118
00:10:49,437 --> 00:10:49,937
Seven,

119
00:10:50,937 --> 00:10:52,937
I got someone to make a new pair of scissors for you.

120
00:10:53,937 --> 00:10:55,437
It can cut through anything!

121
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:06,187
Dai Bo,

122
00:11:07,437 --> 00:11:08,937
you gotta lose some weight.

123
00:11:15,187 --> 00:11:16,187
He doesn’t want me to fight again

124
00:11:18,187 --> 00:11:19,687
Let’s enter the second round.

125
00:11:46,687 --> 00:11:47,937
His Qi’s starting to drop.

126
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:50,187
Now’s a good time to get my sword back.

127
00:12:13,187 --> 00:12:15,437
I am going to cut you in half.

128
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:23,437
I can’t take this directly!

129
00:12:42,437 --> 00:12:43,187
Thumbs-up Style

130
00:12:43,437 --> 00:12:45,187
is a defensive fighting style. Strike first, and I’ll strike back with equal fervor!

131
00:12:46,187 --> 00:12:47,187
When you strike,

132
00:12:47,937 --> 00:12:48,937
you inadvertently reveal your weak points.

133
00:13:00,187 --> 00:13:02,187
What the hell are these weird ass moves?

134
00:13:02,687 --> 00:13:03,687
Cheap Life Hua,

135
00:13:03,687 --> 00:13:04,937
I can do separate attacks too!

136
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:16,937
Wait,

137
00:13:17,437 --> 00:13:18,687
these fragments are—

138
00:13:23,187 --> 00:13:24,687
I learned this trick from you.

139
00:13:28,187 --> 00:13:29,687
I’m still much quicker than you!

140
00:13:30,437 --> 00:13:30,937
Yeah, but

141
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:31,937
this is the Thousand Demon Dagger!

142
00:13:36,687 --> 00:13:37,437
He can dodge even this?

143
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,437
He’s really powerful.

144
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:40,687
However,

145
00:13:41,437 --> 00:13:41,937
I’ve still got something!

146
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:25,437
What’s this thing??

147
00:14:53,437 --> 00:14:55,437
I’ve been secretly accumulating Qi for so long and kept it hidden… without you ever noticing. It’s been so long, and you still didn’t see it coming!

148
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:56,437
Ha! Served you right! You deserve to lose.

149
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:57,937
Okay,

150
00:14:57,937 --> 00:14:59,687
there’s no need to deliberately accommodate my height.

151
00:14:59,937 --> 00:15:00,437
Let’s go!

152
00:15:01,437 --> 00:15:01,937
Seven!

153
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:06,937
You need to lose some weight too!

154
00:15:11,687 --> 00:15:12,937
This guy can still fight??

155
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:15,187
This… Is it even human?!

156
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:22,187
The “perfect assassin” you trained,

157
00:15:22,687 --> 00:15:24,437
dared to defy my orders.

158
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:27,187
The “perfect assassin” is still human.

159
00:15:27,937 --> 00:15:29,687
If they’re human, they will still be susceptible to their own feelings.

160
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:31,437
The next iteration will not have this issue.

161
00:15:32,187 --> 00:15:33,937
I don’t care whatever you do to get there.

162
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:38,187
Then, you want to create a demon?

163
00:15:41,437 --> 00:15:43,937
I will kill off everyone

164
00:15:45,187 --> 00:15:46,937
I’m up next, then.

165
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:48,687
He already lost control.

166
00:15:49,187 --> 00:15:51,187
You too, get out of here as soon as possible!

167
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:54,937
Again?!

168
00:15:56,187 --> 00:15:58,937
I myself, dedicate this body to the earth.

169
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:02,937
May the earth bestow its strength upon me!

170
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:13,437
不是吧
It can’t be…

171
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:15,187
I don’t want to be a clay baked chicken!!

172
00:16:29,187 --> 00:16:30,437
You’re late.

173
00:16:30,937 --> 00:16:32,187
Stone Gate has already

174
00:16:32,187 --> 00:16:33,687
sealed them all shut.

175
00:16:34,687 --> 00:16:35,937
This Crocodile Valley trap

176
00:16:35,937 --> 00:16:37,437
was meant for your capture.

177
00:16:38,187 --> 00:16:39,437
As it turns out, *that* guy came earlier

178
00:16:39,437 --> 00:16:40,937
and stepped on the trap, clearing it

179
00:16:41,937 --> 00:16:43,187
Don’t worry.

180
00:16:43,687 --> 00:16:45,187
As long as we haven’t captured you

181
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,437
our leader won’t kill Green Phoenix.

182
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:50,187
As for where he’s being held?

183
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,937
I don’t know either.

184
00:16:52,437 --> 00:16:53,687
Because our dear, dear leader

185
00:16:53,937 --> 00:16:56,187
won’t even trust anyone at all.

186
00:17:25,187 --> 00:17:28,187
You really haven’t learned Green Phoenix’s style at all.

187
00:17:30,937 --> 00:17:33,937
Green Phoenix really is a meticulous fellow.

188
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:36,937
He had you go to Plum Blossom Villa to learn swordsmanship.

189
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:38,937
This way,

190
00:17:38,937 --> 00:17:41,687
You won’t die so quickly seeking revenge.

191
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:43,687
Secondly,

192
00:17:45,187 --> 00:17:46,687
before you finished learning the full form

193
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:48,687
there will always be a safe haven for you

194
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:52,937
Of present Xuanwu,

195
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:55,687
there’s only Plum Blossom Villa that I dare not engage head-on.

196
00:17:56,937 --> 00:17:58,437
But you seemed to have failed Green Phoenix

197
00:17:58,437 --> 00:17:59,937
and his move.

198
00:18:00,937 --> 00:18:02,187
You havent finished learning the full form,

199
00:18:02,187 --> 00:18:04,437
and now you're here for a wish of death?

200
00:18:06,187 --> 00:18:08,187
Perhaps, the one who’s going to throw his life away

201
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:10,437
is you.
—----------------------Mr. Line break—---------------

202
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:33,437
好天气 (fix this up later)

203
00:18:45,937 --> 00:18:46,437
等明天会不会放晴

204
00:18:59,937 --> 00:19:02,187
等昨天已不怕回忆

205
00:19:02,687 --> 00:19:05,187
想念的你

206
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:10,187
散落着灰暗的情

207
00:19:10,437 --> 00:19:13,187
想念的你

208
00:19:13,437 --> 00:19:16,437
决定要一个人旅行

209
00:19:18,937 --> 00:19:21,187
相遇

210
00:19:21,937 --> 00:19:23,687
都不是在夏季

211
00:19:24,687 --> 00:19:28,687
放晴的好天气

212
00:19:29,187 --> 00:19:30,687
像注定要别离

213
00:19:32,687 --> 00:19:33,187
餐像注定要别离

214
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:41,437
充满着温暖的情绪

215
00:19:41,937 --> 00:19:44,687
想念的你

216
00:19:44,937 --> 00:19:49,687
愿望你结束这旅行

217
00:19:49,937 --> 00:19:52,187
再遇

218
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:55,937
虽不是好天气

219
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:59,937
也不必再努力

220
00:20:00,187 --> 00:20:04,687
地要和谁别离

221
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:08,187
相遇

222
00:20:08,187 --> 00:20:13,687
就会是好天气
