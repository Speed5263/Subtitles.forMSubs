1
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:35,454
Mission 5: Nine-fingered Zither Demon

2
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,750
It’s all the fault of that thumbs-up guy.

3
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,500
And look… You’re now listed in the Skysword’s blacklist…

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,500
Now, we can only walk to Plum Blossom Villa by foot.

5
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,000
I think I stepped on a turd.

6
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,750
There may still be other means of transport.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,750
Just like in the movies.

8
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,000
What is it again?

9
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,000
It’s as simple as riding a flying dragon.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,500
Look! Seems like there’s an inn!

11
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,250
We get to eat something… finally!

12
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,250
All you know about life is eating and nothing else!

13
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,750
An inn… what is it about?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,500
A place for sleeping and eating

15
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,000
?

16
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,750
In martial arts movies,

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,500
it’s the place to be for gathering intelligence

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,750
Anyways… I’m a bit hungry.

19
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,500
Walk faster!

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,000
X

21
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,250
Welcome, good sirs! Please come over here.

22
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,250
This way, this way.

23
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,750
Argh… seems like we got a lot of guests today.

24
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,750
You both don’t mind sharing tables?

25
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,500
Teller of fortunes

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,500
What do you two want to eat?

27
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Lend me your pen.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,250
Since this is a place for gathering intel,

29
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,250
it’s only natural to ask.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,750
I want to ask

31
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,250
have you seen her before?
Never.

32
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:13,750
I don’t know.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,250
Hi Mr. Teller,

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,250
may I ask… have you ever seen this person?

35
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
Maybe you can even calculate my fate to end up with her.

36
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,750
Fortune telling my ass.

37
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,500
I’m a professional musician.

38
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,250
Custom love songs

39
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,000
Ten taels for one.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,250
I’m your composer, lyricist, arranger and recorder.

41
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,000
Hey. Order something.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,500
Hey.

43
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,750
It’s all part of the package.
It’s all included in ten taels!

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,500
ORDER FOOD

45
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,250
Uh… Is there that type of song?

46
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,250
Um, about expressing how you feel

47
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,000
about a certain someone when you meet them again after a long time?

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,250
It’s about the feelings in my heart…

49
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,500
“I miss you”, those things…

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,500
For sure!

51
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,750
I’m a professional!

52
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,000
*Pay first, get your custom song later*

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Cassette tape *The Prince of Love Songs | Compilation*

54
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,750
Didn’t you just say it’s a custom song?

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
This is the “custom” we’re talking about, sir!

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,250
You have to appreciate how fast I composed those songs… Sir!

57
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,500
You have to appreciate how fast I composed those songs…
Order something or I’m gonna throw you out!

58
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Don’t worry!
Order something or I’m gonna throw you out!

59
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,500
I’m a professional musician!

60
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,250
I’m a professional musician!
Then… serve some signature dishes!

61
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:05,750
Then… serve some signature dishes!

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,250
The best wine you’ve got too!

63
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,000
Ok.

64
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Sir, you spend generously!

65
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,750
See if you recognise the person in the painting.

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,750
Certainly, sir!

67
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,500
Is this a painting of a person?

68
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,750
It’s a woman. She’s a beauty!

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,250
You draw too badly.

70
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,000
Look at me.

71
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,000
Back then… I almost got admitted to the Academy of Fine Arts.
*DAYUM😳🙏*

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,750
That doesn’t look like her.

73
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,000
Let me!

74
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,250
Amazing! It looks just like her!

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,500
But how are you able to draw her realistically?

76
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,000
Are you guys looking for her?

77
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,500
She’s wanted!

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,500
Seven.

79
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,250
That guy under… doesn’t he kinda look like you?

80
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:51,750
X

81
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,500
Doesn’t he look kinda like you?

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,750
Not at all!

83
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,750
Not at all!

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,500
Seems like it’s not him…

85
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,250
nothing will happen

86
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,750
Things like this happen all the time in Martial Arts movies.

87
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,500
Draw a beard and people won’t recognise you.

88
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,750
I’m telling you,

89
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,000
that sonic bird of mine.

90
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,250
She’s fast and has a low center of gravity!

91
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,250
It will only take two more days…

92
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,000
Two more days and we will get to the Plum Blossom Villa!

93
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,250
Let’s drink… Drink, drink!

94
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,250
*Fine wine* My brothers!

95
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,000
I heard you lot are heading to the Plum Blossom Villa.

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,750
Can’t I get a lift too?

97
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,750
You’re also urgently on your way to the Plum Blossom Villa?

98
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,250
Are you there to also catch that wanted criminal?

99
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,500
Of course, not!

100
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,250
When did I ever have abilities?

101
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
Forget my brusqueness, but I’ve got a question.

102
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Which of the wanted criminals are you two going to pursue?

103
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,500
We decided on that female assassin!

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That look she’s got… Mmm…

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,750
If I get to catch her,

106
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,000
I will…

107
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,750
Sorry, sorry.

108
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,500
My hands shook, they shook.

109
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
Informants said

110
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,250
they saw her just arriving at Plum Blossom Villa.

111
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,750
This biotch.

112
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,250
Really! She’s going to seduce the owner!

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I’m really sorry.

114
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,750
My legs suddenly cramped.

115
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,750
Let me refill your glass.

116
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,750
Nothing good came out of that mouth of yours.

117
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,750
Let me add a little “something.” 😳💘

118
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,250
Yurrrr wasteyute fam

119
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,500
What in the hell… This tastes like…

120
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,500
The weather is nice today.

121
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,250
You see?

122
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,250
We’re not alike.

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,750
Eat shit la—

124
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,250
Dai Bo!

125
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:16,750
Run!

126
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,000
Too late to shout!

127
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,250
He’s that wanted guy!

128
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:30,034
Man of the thousand kilo axes!

129
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:34,866
Steely claws | white clouds

130
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,250
Isn’t... this too much of a spectacle?

131
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,000
Kill his chicken first as a side dish to our drinking!

132
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,500
Miao Cai?

133
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,500
It's not Miao Cai!

134
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,000
It's the Fortune Teller guy!

135
00:07:12,028 --> 00:07:13,028
*Demonic Sound Binding*

136
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:38,025
*Professional*

137
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,250
In my heart

138
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
you’re my one and only

139
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,250
You took away my heart

140
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,500
I dare not to tell you

141
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,750
From that time onwards... I'm absent-minded

142
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,750
How do I make a small wish come true?

143
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Guard the heart

144
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,250
that innocent, immaculate heart of yours

145
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,500
I don’t care about what other say about us

146
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,000
X

147
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:23,000
Nothing is sadder than seeing you shed tears

148
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:29,000
I really, really wish you can see me

149
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:34,500
Just who’s memories stayed here?

150
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,500
What you once had, was what I experienced

151
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,000
even if it failed

152
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
please don’t give up on that tugging feeling on your heart

153
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,500
Everything will follow their predestined path

154
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,750
Skies of starlight in the sky, countless wishes,

155
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:04,250
Is there one I can look forward to?

156
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,750
I wished silently by myself

157
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,750
In my heart, I hoped your voice will appear

158
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,500
Have you found?

159
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I said to you

160
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,500
come and walk the path forward with me

161
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:37,750
Hey

162
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,500
The singing ended

163
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,500
Wake up! Hey

164
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,750
Hey! Wake up! Hey!

165
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,250
Thank you, noble hero, for coming to my rescue

166
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,750
Thank me for what?

167
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,000
Didn’t I took your money?

168
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,750
That song from just now

169
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,250
It’s the custom love song you ordered

170
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,250
That ugly-sounding and sad singing voice of yours

171
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,750
It’s very alike to a friend of mine

172
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,006
*Don't want to be the murk of love...*

173
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,750
Could it be… You’re Miao Cai’s master?

174
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,500
Oh! Turns out Ah Cai is your friend.

175
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,250
No wonder your temperaments are so similar.

176
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,000
Why doesn’t that sound like something good?

177
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,500
Ah Cai’s friend is my friend

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,250
I just heard you guys are going to… what is it?

179
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,500
something something Plum Blossom Villa of Northern Xuanwu

180
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,750
I’ll take you there

181
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,500
I’ve got a car…

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,250
You said I’m not “man” enough?

183
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,250
Why does it seem like a sugarcane

184
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,500
You said I’m not “man” enough?

185
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,750
I only got a six pack and a beer belly

186
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,750
You said I’m not “man” enough?
How about

187
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,750
You said I’m not “man” enough?
Seems like we’re better off walking

188
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,000
X

189
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,250
I don’t know how to do makeup to look better
We better walk

190
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,750
I don’t know how to do makeup to look better

191
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,750
Yet another day

192
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,250
A new morning of sunshine

193
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,750
Friends! Who is still stuck in their dreams?

194
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Lazy bums! Why aren’t you awake?

195
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,500
Today, I got to change into a suave looking T-shirt too

196
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,000
I’m going out with full energy

197
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Riding my humble motocompo

198
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,500
taking a slow drive around my community

199
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,750
The bad tempers of yesterday

200
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,750
let me tell you about it all

201
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,000
All those troubles

202
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,000
will be forgotten today

203
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I don’t want them to accumulate in me anymore

204
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,250
the secrets of summer

205
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,250
Occasionally, the aroma of Durian drift through my nose

206
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,000
Kitten, let’s play!

207
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,500
Happy emotions

208
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
surrounds the community

209
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,250
There’s something new everyday

210
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Happy emotions

211
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
surrounds the community

212
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,500
There’s something new everyday

213
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,250
We got it every year

214
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,000
Fresh new uploads
