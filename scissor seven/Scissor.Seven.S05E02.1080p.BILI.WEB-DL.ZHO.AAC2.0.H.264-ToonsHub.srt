1
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:35,871
Mission 3: The return to Xuanwu

2
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,332
Hmm…? There isn’t much of a difference at all

3
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:48,874
Stick out your tongue

4
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,374
hmm... a little too moist in there

5
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,290
I’ll prescribe you with some meds

6
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,499
eight bowls of water, simmer into one.

7
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,999
normally, avoid drinking ice-cold water

8
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,332
It was ME who helped removed the poison from your body

9
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:00,957
remember to treat me to a meal later

10
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:01,957
Ah! My beer D:

11
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,040
What a waste. What a waste…

12
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,374
Erm… “This” you got…

13
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:12,874
Have you…remembered.. anything from your past?

14
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:14,540
Let me try

15
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,249
Umm. Which elementary school did I go to?

16
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,249
Umm.

17
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,290
Nope. Can’t remember anything at all.

18
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:22,540
Nope. Not even my secondary school.

19
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:25,790
Seven
This doesn’t make sense

20
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:27,832
The poison has already been cleared out of your system

21
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,165
Take this. Try to recall how you used this weapon in the past.

22
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,499
Gosh! I’m seeing some terrifying things!

23
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:24,624
Yup, seems like he’s fine now.

24
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,165
The remnants of poison in your body has been fully purged.

25
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,915
It’s just that the memories from your past have been forgotten for a long period of time.

26
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:37,665
You need a little something to bring those memories back

27
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:42,040
As long as you come into contact with objects and people from your past,

28
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,332
your memories will slowly come back

29
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,582
it’s just like playing with a jigsaw puzzle.

30
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,665
So, once he starts gaining back his memories,

31
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,665
would there be any change to his persona…

32
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,374
Hey, hey! Seven, seven!

33
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:05,707
Chicken Island is all safe now

34
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,499
We’ve already beaten up White Fox!

35
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,790
You can rest assured and go rescue Ms. Assassin in peace

36
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:11,499
It’s time for a different shot

37
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,457
Come over here for your anti-inflammatory jab!

38
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,207
Handsome! Let me tell you what happened.

39
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,874
The other day, there’s this guy who showed up on Chicken Island

40
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,040
He makes things go boom.

41
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,874
But I’ve crushed him!

42
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:22,707
No need to praise me.

43
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:26,124
Ye ol trusty stabby never dulls!

44
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,473
Oh, oh let me send you a photo.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,665
Seems like Chicken Island is all safe and sound now.

46
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,749
So do you want to get going?

47
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:43,749
Eh? What’s everyone looking at?

49
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,999
Hmm? That’s some sharp senses

48
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,874
He managed to detect the incoming enemy’s presence earlier than I did…

49
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,290
You’re not from Superpower Country,

50
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,582
what are you even hiding for?

51
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,040
I’m kidnapped by people who wore something similar.

52
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,582
Who knows if they’re here again to take me to somewhere else?

53
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:28,374
We need to bring back a few kids with superpowers back to experiment with.

54
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,874
Once we’re done with the experiment, they will be brought back.

55
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,249
I’ll go back with you.

56
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,082
It’s not like I have been to Stan for a holiday before,

57
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,624
do I need to be handcuffed?

58
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,957
Come~ Get me~ Come and get me~

59
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,082
A quick scan have shown that

60
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,999
the few of you don’t have any Superpower electrowaves in your body

61
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,124
you guys are not from Superpower Country.

62
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:52,582
That's not always the case.

63
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,249
The adults in Superpower Countries are useless

64
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,040
The younger they are, the stronger their abilities.

65
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:00,915
As they grow older, their abilities become mediocre.

66
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,415
We only need to grab that one child.

67
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:07,374
His body contains a very strong level of Healing-type electrowave.

68
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,540
Help me!

69
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,624
Still not fighting back?

70
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,790
RELEASE OUR ARCHMAGE!!

71
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,665
Gigantamaxed Conch… Drill!!!

72
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,582
All of these people are your enemy!

73
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,540
They must die!

74
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
[Three Point throw]

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,625
[SCORE!!!]

76
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,499
Enough.

77
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,040
Scaring them off is enough

78
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,665
They are all your enemy.

79
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,540
Stanians must die!

80
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,124
Think.

81
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,624
If you kill them now

82
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,207
and then you leave this place forever

83
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,790
in the end the ones who end up suffering,

84
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,540
won’t it be the Superpower people?

85
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,499
You need to keep your head

86
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,624
Um, don’t.

87
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,165
Seven.

88
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,749
I think I saw something with a very strong murderous aura over there

89
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,124
Let’s not go out for now

90
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,665
Seems like I’ve saved a demon.

91
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,457
You got to learn how to control yourself,

92
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:37,332
Handsome.

93
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,165
Let me teach you

94
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,290
It seemed to be just a very normal leg move.

95
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,207
Why would there be such a devastating power to it?

96
00:08:03,188 --> 00:08:04,438
Claw of the dragon!

97
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,290
See? I can do two-part attacks too!

98
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,499
Turns out he can even control his sword like that!

99
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,431
Golden Iron Palm!
(nah tried my best on this TL)

100
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,624
You have such a formidable power.

101
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,082
What is it for?

102
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:24,290
Once you own this unparalleled power,

103
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,790
what would you do with it?

104
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,332
Just to kill?

105
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,665
If you were to truly show off how strong you are,

106
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,124
you would use it to SAVE people!

107
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,915
With such strong powers,

108
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,124
It would be really easy to turn into something diabolical.

109
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,165
What’s hard, is not losing yourself to evil.

110
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,582
I’ve used too much energy just now to heal you.

111
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,165
I have to act fast now and use my ultimate ability.

112
00:10:24,212 --> 00:10:25,628
The Supreme Dragon Emperor: Heaven and Earth!

113
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,082
As for the path that lay before you

114
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,874
It all hinges on your choices

115
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:10,957
Miss Mei,

116
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,790
did you just rub your hand on salted fish?

117
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,957
See, He’s awake now.

118
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,457
I told you this will work like magic.

119
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,124
If it wasn't for the fact you just saved someone,

120
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:25,874
I would've killed you already!

121
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,249
I’m sorry about hurting you.

122
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:29,832
It’s nothing.

123
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,082
How could you ever be able to hurt me?

124
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,374
I literally let myself be slashed twice by you, on purpose!

125
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,624
What about that sword?

126
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,582
It’s best that you don’t ever use it again.

127
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,832
What you have is simply just a mortal shell of flesh and blood.

128
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,915
Your body had gone through so many serious injuries.

129
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,540
It’s already quite weak

130
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:54,082
That sword is no ordinary weapon

131
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,499
It belongs to a class of its own sorts: “The blade of evil spirits”

132
00:11:56,375 --> 00:12:00,790
When you use it, it will rapidly absorb your body’s Qi,

133
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,040
causing irreversible damage to your body.

134
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,832
Based on your body’s current condition,

135
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,040
you will be able to only sustain it for short fights.

136
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,332
Uhm… What if..

137
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,624
Just in case…

138
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,124
What if it’s a really dire situation,

139
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,540
and I have no choice but to use it?

140
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,165
Usage should never exceed a minute.

141
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,832
Say, you can use it for just about another three to five times.

142
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:27,915
Then, what if he use it more than that number?

143
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:29,874
He will die.

144
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,540
You should be on your way to Xuanwu now

145
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,332
also, it's about time for you to search for the answer you are looking for.

146
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,874
Here, I’ve got a pouch.

*Marvellous!*

147
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,457
When you are in absolute danger, open it up and take a look at the items inside.

148
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,207
It might be able to help you.

149
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,165
Heh, heh, heh, heh…

150
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,999
We meet again, my little fat chicken…

151
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,874
We have specially bought a new batch of weapons, just waiting for you.

152
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,665
Brothers, please accept this small gift of mine.

153
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:21,790
You aren’t allowed to lift your fingers!

154
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,749
Young hero, let’s have some tea altogether when you're free!

155
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,665
Da Bao, who’s usually all proud..

156
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,207
He did all this for me–

157
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,332
Thank you, Da Bao

158
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,665
You got the help of the Evil Spirit.

159
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,040
Naturally, you have to pay a huge price for it.

160
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:04,874
Once you deal with everything, go and return the sword back to its original place.

161
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:09,749
That’s if you want to lead a peaceful life

162
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,165
Miss Mei,

163
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,249
