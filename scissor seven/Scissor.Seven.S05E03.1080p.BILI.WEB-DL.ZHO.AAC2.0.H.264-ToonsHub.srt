The following is a special news report

8
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,165
An explosion rocked Chicken Island last week

9
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:54,624
Houses are wrecked everywhere

10
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,165
We can already see it today

11
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,499
Many people are already starting to rebuild their homes

12
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,665
Let’s interview some people

13
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:04,457
Excuse me, may I ask about what happened during the explosion?

14
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,915
And… just who was it that defeated the Xuanwu assassins in the end?

15
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,207
You... go fetch that brick on the floor for me

16
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:14,124
The heck you asking me for?

17
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,249
I have a question for you!

18
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,665
Just who in the hell was it that blew up my house?

19
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:17,457
Pay me back!!!

20
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:19,457
Reports say that this clinic

21
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:21,332
took in those injured in the battle.

22
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:22,999
Let's go in and interview them

23
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,040
Uh... Looks like this bunch can't speak for now...

24
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:30,791
Kiddo,

25
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:32,415
May I ask, who was it at that time

26
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,749
that defeated those Xuanwu assassins?

27
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,124
You must be talking about White Fox

28
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,957
At that time, we couldn't beat him.

29
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:41,957
But then I fainted...

30
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:43,124
After that,

31
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,374
when I woke up, I'm already here

32
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:47,040
I know just who it was that defeated White Fox!

33
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:48,915
Excuse me then-

34
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:49,665
That's right!

35
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,124
It was me!

36
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:54,249
That's right,

37
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,415
indeed, it was quite dangerous.

38
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:59,582
There were two very powerful Xuanwu assassins;

39
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,207
one was called White Fox,

40
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,082
the other Redtooth.

41
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:03,374
I knew

42
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,290
I have to take action by then

43
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,832
The punch of the unrivalled old geezer!!!

44
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,457
Backspin toronado!!! Meet your demise with my gouty foot

45
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:31,439
😳😭🙏

46
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:32,665
Just who are you?

47
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:33,957
Why so strong?

48
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,499
Call me

49
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:37,874
Uncle Chen

50
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,499
You stand here recording

51
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,124
I will look way cooler if only you took a low-angle shot

52
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,707
The truth couldn't be further from what he said

53
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:51,665
In actuality... it was us that has beaten that no-name assassin

54
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,207

00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,582
Back then,

64
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,207
we thought we were already dead

65
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,207
and then,

66
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,165
how should i say it?

67
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,499
It's about that guy over there

68
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:31,999
Go ask him directly

69
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,165
But

70
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,915
it may be a bit dangerous

71
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:37,749
Excuse me

72
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,332
Was it you

73
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,624
that defeated White Fox the assassin?

74
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,290
You guys want to know about

75
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,957
what happened on that day?

76
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,915
Why did he not put up his defense at all?

77
00:04:08,427 --> 00:04:18,426
Fire in the hole ahh💀

78
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:28,841
🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔊🔊🔊💯

79
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:29,957
WHY???

80
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,249
Why didn't you activate the Blood Demon's power as protection?

81
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,582
Your power after you remove the seal will be unmatched

82
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,457
no one can win against you

83
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,915
You are a useless waste of space

84
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:42,165
Let me take over your body

85
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,915
You... are nothing but a piece of bestial monstrosity

86
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,040
There's nothing I can do

87
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,665
The only way is to hit him with all of my remaining strength

88
00:05:00,004 --> 00:05:02,003
ZAMN

89
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,374
The Blood Demon has been using you for the whole time

90
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:16,999
After i removed your seal

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,790
he may take advantage of this situation to take over your body.

92
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:20,665
You yourself should think it over clearly

93
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,707
ABSOLUTELY no one can power over me

94
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,374
including YOU

95
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,582
Back then you said all of your powers are available for my use

96
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,499
it was nothing but bs

97
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,249
you wanted nothing but to prey on me

98
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,832
Escape the White Lotus Seal array

99
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,415
with this body of mine together...

100
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,124
Let's face our demise!

101
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,540
You absolutely pos

102
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,124
I need to leave this body immediately

103
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,540
I want-

104
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,749
I want to change into this body of flesh

105
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,290
Christ

106
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:24,915
My energy levels are all depleted

107
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:26,540
Floragraft!

108
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,332
Burst!

109
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,415
Suddenly I feel...

110
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,957
my body is so light

111
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,415
Is this all part of your plan?

112
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,332
I'm not like you,

113
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,457
who obsesses over with planning everything

114
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,332
No more than a pighead...

115
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,249
You no longer have the power of the Blood Demon

116
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,707
Let’s see what you have left

117
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:21,165
It’s actually us who are this Island’s strongest barbers

118
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,124
I hate hairstylists the most

119
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,165
We’re really sorry that

120
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,124
we’re late

121
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,207
Bring that assassin back

122
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,249
Do research on him thoroughly

123
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,082
Why are our attacks useless against him?

124
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,040
You, stay

125
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,082
treat the girl

126
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,040
protect her with care

127
00:08:05,438 --> 00:08:15,853
🤨

128
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,874
What was he laughing about?

129
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,040
So you’re…

130
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,207
You’re an Xuanwu assassin

131
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,249
Film me…

132
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,499
and you’re going to die

133
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,540
We didn’t, we didn’t

134
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,165
It wasn’t even turn on

135
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,040
Turns out

136
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:00,957
Turns out

137
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,499
The trio from SMT hair salon really defeated White Fox

138
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:05,415
Forget it

139
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:06,749
It all doesn’t matter

140
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,207
I couldn’t have prepared anything either way

141
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,374
Last question

142
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,457
If White Fox is your "colleague"

143
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:14,915
Then why…

144
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,040
Why are you here to protect Chicken Island?

145
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,082
The white lotus seal on your body has already been unbinded

146
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:26,915
You’re faster than me.

147
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,707
Go back to Chicken Island, fast.

148
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:29,874
It shouldn’t even take up a day

149
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,082
Actually

150
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,290
What you said on the way

151
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:35,915
I heard it all.

152
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,749
Why didn’t you tell me before

153
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,250
Ah Quan

154
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,207
What’s between us

155
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,124
Isn’t the sect’s rules;

156
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,999
It’s not even about all the others’ judgemental gazes

157
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,624
It’s the guilt in my heart

158
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,999
Say what you want about me. You can call me stubborn

159
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,374
Stupid, you can say too

160
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,374
Yet I just couldn't face this sense of guilt

161
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,499
I grew up in the White Lotus Sect since I was a kid...

162
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,457
Whatever master said,

163
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,124
will be what rules my world.

164
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,999
Later, I left Xuanwu,

165
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,790
and found that

166
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,165
there are so many ways to live out my life in this world.

167
00:10:31,628 --> 00:10:32,583
"Chairman's outfit of the day"

168
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,332
I really am a stiff...

169
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,332
Even on Chicken Island, I'm still so stubborn...

170
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,624
Still…

171
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:40,957
I just couldn't stop myself from loving Chicken Island.

172
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:42,957
You...

173
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,832
can also go with me...

174
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:47,457
I won't leave anymore.

175
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,999
I want to stay here and provide company for Master.

176
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:54,582
Hence...

177
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,249
Please help me...

178
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,290
protect Chicken Island from harm.

179
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:01,624
Oh yes...

180
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:02,999
Ah Quan, your shoes are gone

181
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,415
She…

182
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,457
for the past ten years,

183
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,707
just what kind of life has she led?

184
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:16,750
You got it,

185
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,874
that corner... add some extra glue

186
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,040
This corner too

187
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:26,915
Hey

188
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,540
I want to know…

189
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:29,832
that old hag…

190
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,870
Just what kind of work does she typically do on this Island?

191
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,749
Are you talking about Chairman Jiang?

192
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,624
She is the "Island Purity Society's" chairwoman,

193
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,707
and is mainly responsible for maintaining the Island's

194
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:41,415
overall social climate

195
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,374
and environment

196
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,040
I don’t want to hear your nonsense

197
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,790
From now on, let me

198
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,499
replace her as your chairman

199
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,332
Now assign me a job, immediately!

200
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,665
How have I become so weak now?

201
00:12:07,657 --> 00:12:08,657
1. Right-willed mountain school: Popular Science seminar
2. Nursing home volunteer diagnoses
3. Divorce Counselling (Conflict Mediation)
4. Night patrol

202
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,499
Why

203
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,374
That look he sports originally

204
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,415
will scare away the children

205
00:12:15,864 --> 00:12:17,031
Influenza prevention info seminar: Spring Edition
❌Chairman Jiang ✅Mr. Redtooth

206
00:12:17,031 --> 00:12:18,447
What is he talking about

207
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:22,665
Spring…

208
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,332
*This teacher is so weird* Spring is…

209
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:25,790
*Eh his hair is green* the season of mainstream songs

210
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,457
The season where influenza…

211
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:28,624
*If there's a Chairman Redtooth, where's Yellowtooth?*
and the common cold is…

212
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:29,957
most rampant

213
00:12:32,445 --> 00:12:33,029
His hair is so green... his girlfriend must have dumped him (i.e. The green hat in Canto slang)

214
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,540
Everyone should take precautions to prevent being infected…

215
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,290
Screw off if y’all dare make another noise!

216
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:41,916
Oh dear…

217
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,874
"I feel so SO much more comfortable…" 💀

218
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:58,874
Thanks a million, doctor!

219
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,040
This waist problem of yours… isn’t it obvious I can’t cure you?

220
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:03,957
To be honest, I’m not a doctor…

221
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,082
Doctor, are you married?

222
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,124
My son has been married for many years…

223
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,540
No one asked…

224
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:10,624
What did you say?

225
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:11,749
Did you say “What job does he do?”

226
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,790
My son, he’s in “that” business…

227
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,374
It’s just like trading…

228
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,832
It’s about transporting… whatchamcallit?

229
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,124
Textiles and metals

230
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,415
to, I guess, Xuanwu?

231
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:21,957
It’s very lucrative…

232
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,207
Anyways he travels ALL around the world…

233
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,874
doesn’t come back often

234
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:27,332
Right

235
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:28,457
Doctor, you…

236
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:29,832
have you married yet?

237
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,124
You said that over and over again

238
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,457
Just go away if you’re not here anymore for seeing a doctor

239
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,624
Thank you, doctor!

240
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,665
Really, thank you!

241
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,249
I literally didn’t do anything…

242
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,874
Come to my place for dinner when you’re free!

243
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,290
My son…

244
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:48,790
he’s a travelling businessman…

245
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,457
Goes abroad frequently!

246
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:53,415
Doctor

247
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,040
The waist is a bit above

248
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,415
Be honest! Have you ever cared about me?

249
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,749
How come you say I’ve never cared about me?

250
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,624
Do you even know what I’m thinking right now?

251
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,332
How can I know if you don’t tell me?

252
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,374
You don’t even care about me; of course you don’t know

253
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,915
You only ever thought about you and yourself

254
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,957
You two

255
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:12,832
You two shut up

256
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:18,999
We’re leaving

257
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,415
This evening is airing that TV show’s final episode

258
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,290
Where is the plot progressing?

259
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,374
Has that undercover agent died?

260
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,832
Finally… it’s over

261
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,999
It’s way more tiring than being an assassin…

262
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:32,430
*-didn't die, but got shot with a gun*

263
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,429
*They say the guy got dextrocardia or something...*

264
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:39,221
*Then should I get some peanuts and a few beers on our way home?*

265
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:41,208
*I want to eat watermelon*

266
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,415
These people really are a bunch of freaks

267
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:45,249
Time’s up

268
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,207
Let’s go

269
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:48,915
Didn’t I tell you?

270
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,415
Eight-thirty to Eleven sharp:

271
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,457
night patrol

272
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:54,540
So damn annoying

273
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,457
Go this way

274
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,124
Shut up!

275
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,665
Why did he change his clothes back again?

276
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:11,749
Patrolling like this

277
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,165
make us look more powerful

278
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,874
this is Chairman Jiang’s

279
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:26,665
steamed bun shop

280
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,124
Everyday, from six to half past eight,

281
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,749
She sells steamed buns here

282
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,624
Once it finished, she start off for work

283
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,332
Actually…

284
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,374
Why did the chairman open a steamed bun shop?

285
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,457
I don’t know either…

286
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:39,915
I asked her before

287
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,624
“Why is it named that way?”

288
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:43,665
And she said,

289
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,790
It’s simply a homophonic wordplay on “all year no rest” (Quan / lian never rests, Redtooth x Chairman Jiang forever 🥰)

290
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,253
That’s the worst pun i ever heard…

291
00:15:49,436 --> 00:15:52,003
Stay for Eng translation of outro song

292
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:14,207
Wait for good weather

293
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:17,124
Wait for tomorrow

294
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:22,165
Will it be sunny?

295
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:29,749
Wait for tomorrow

296
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,040
Wait for yesterday

297
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,957
No longer afraid of those memories

298
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,707
I miss u

299
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:45,249
Scattered with dark emotions

300
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,832
The you in my memories

301
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:53,040
decided to go on a trip on your own

302
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,249
It’s not even in summer

303
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:03,415
Good weather where the sun shines through…

304
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:07,540
Like we’re destined to part ways…

305
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:38,582
Those migrating has gone through the four seasons

306
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,332
In search of land

307
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,707
They are the continuance of the eternal footsteps of their ancestors

308
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:55,499
A promise made for a life of happiness

309
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,957
The “you” I’m missing

310
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:03,457
Is filled with the warmth of emotions

311
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,915
The “you” I’m missing

312
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:11,249
Wishes that you will end your travels

313
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,249
Let’s meet again

314
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,082
Even if the weather is bad

315
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:22,040
and we don’t need to fuss over things again…

316
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,249
Who needs to separate from each other? :D
