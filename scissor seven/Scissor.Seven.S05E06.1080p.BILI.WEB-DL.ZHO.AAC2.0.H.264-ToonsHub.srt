Mission 6: The brave rush into Plum Blossom Villa

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,250
You say I'm not MAN enough?

3
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,500
You don’t look at a mirror before you’re out for a movie

4
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,000
Hey, wake up!

5
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,250
Don’t be too enchanted by my singing…

6
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,500
We’re at Plum Blossom Villa now

7
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,750
It’s not even my turn yet to fan you

8
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:57,035
Subs by oofvegetable (and translators in our awesome Discord server :D)
Don't steal our subs in any way (You know who you are)

9
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,500
Have we arrived yet?

10
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,250
It’s right up there

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,250
Time flies in happy times…

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,250
how about

13
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,250
At last, let me sing you another school song

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,750
“You drooled on your desk during the lunch nap”

15
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,500
no no no

16
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,000
no need, great swordsman,

17
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,750
leave that for the next time

18
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,500
We’re in a hurry

19
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,250
Mr. nine-fingers

20
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,500
Actually, we run a hair salon

21
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,750
If you ever decide to hold a concert

22
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,000
and you need a new hairstyle,

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,750
feel free to reach out to us!

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,250
Thank you for bringing us all this way

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,500
Bye bye!

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,500
Hold on a second

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,750
This is…

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's a fruit basket!

29
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,250
I heard you were looking for that girl called…

30
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:39,750
Plum Blossom something

31
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,500
It’s Plum Blossom Thirteen.
Plum Blossom something

32
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,250
It’s Plum Blossom Thirteen.
This place is called Plum Blossom Villa

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,500
Meeting her parents, eh?

34
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,500
Guessing it’s your first time?

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,750
Nononono
You can’t just show up empty handed!

36
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,500
You can’t just show up empty handed!

37
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,750
At least bring some fruits, eh

38
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,750
and a chicken too!

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,500
It's all about giving them a good first impression

40
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,500
Good morning uncle

41
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,500
My name is Wu Liuqi.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
even though I'm not that much of being economically stable,

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But I'm going to try my best!

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,750
You really took it as meeting the parents...

45
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,250
Hello there,

46
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,000
Is there anyone home?

47
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,750
It’s an automatic door?

48
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,250
You scaredy cat!

49
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:10,750
automatic my arse!

50
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,750
It was me who pushed it open

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,750
Come in then!

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,250
Wouldn't this be too impolite?

53
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,000
Uncle, hello!

54
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,500
My name is Wu Liuqi.

55
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
These fruits and this chicken,

56
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,000
just a little something!

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,500
No way

58
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,250
Dachun…?

59
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,750
Have we…

60
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,000
come to the wrong place?

61
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,000
We’re here

62
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,250
This is Plum Blossom Villa

63
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:05,750
Right,

64
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,250
My name is Plum Blossom Eleven.

65
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,750
This used to be my home.

66
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,000
Right now,

67
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
its forcibly occupied by a cranky old man!

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
They went too far!

69
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,500
I’ll go teach them some manners!

70
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,000
I’m here to retrieve a certain something of mine

71
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,750
But

72
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,000
That old guy’s swordsmanship…

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
is really, really good

74
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,500
You may lose your life if you’re not careful enough

75
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,500
It’s not too late for you to regret right now

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
X

77
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,750
First code of the Bodyguards’ handbook!

78
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,250
Once you accepted a task,

79
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,750
never retreat!

80
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,250
Take it.

81
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,250
You’re my bodyguard.

82
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,000
From the moment we enter through this door,

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,500
No matter what happens,

84
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,750
You must still protect me

85
00:03:56,012 --> 00:04:00,011

Don't steal our subs in any way (You know who you are)

86
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,750
This is the place

87
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,000
It’s you again…

88
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,000
Lucky that the Villa’s owner isn’t here today

89
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,500
otherwise,

90
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,250
he’s going to kill you!

91
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
You’re that

92
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
squatting, white haired old man?

93
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,000
I want to teach you some manners.

94
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,000
The white haired old man I was talking about…

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,750
that’s not him.

96
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,000
He…

97
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,500
is just the housekeeper.

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,750
I apologise,

99
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,500
mister housekeeper.

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,750
I don’t really care if he’s here or not.

101
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,000
I’m just gonna go inside to grab my stuff.

102
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,500
This place…

103
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,750
doesn’t have a damn thing that’s yours

104
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,500
Indestructible Virgin Body?

105
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,000
This girl’s cruel and ruthless

106
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,500
The last time she’s here, she harmed our young master.

107
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,000
这次又要来偷东西
And now… you’re here again to steal!

108
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,500
Listen up pentagon face,

109
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
if you insist on protecting her,

110
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,750
then don’t put the blame on me if I use excessive force.

111
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,750
Do you trust him,

112
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,500
or do you trust me?

113
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,000
No. 5 of Bodyguards’ Handbook—

114
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:43,750
Shut up.

115
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Seems like we have to defeat him first.

116
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,000
Wait a sec.

117
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,750
That shirt… it's very very expensive!

118
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,000
Skywards pillar: The ONE

119
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,250
I’m poking your eyes!

120
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,500
Mount Tai is weighing on me

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Too insidious!

122
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,000
Solid As Gold: Seven Day Lock!!!

123
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,750
We can’t defeat him!

124
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
I’ve got him locked

125
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,500
Go get your things, quickly!

126
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,750
You're dead!

127
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,000
金金
金刚

128
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,000
金刚不坏
Solid as gold,

129
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,500
也要运功才能使出来的
It take some effort to dish out the attack.

130
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,250
If I repeatedly attack your temple,

131
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,250
there’s no way you can dish out the attack move!

132
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,000
Damn it,

133
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
He really can’t deal out attacks invincibly anymore!

134
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,250
Go quickly!

135
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
Bodyguard Handbook…

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,750
Irrelevant—

137
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,750
I TRUST YOU!!!

138
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,500
There’s no way around it.

139
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,250
I’ve got to use THAT technique.

This… isn’t this the long lost “Rope of Divinity” of the martial underworld?

142
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,250
Once you’re tied up,

143
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,750
there’s no way you can exert force!

144
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,250
You broke ass looking doorkeeper

145
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,000
how can a low life like you own a contraption like this…

146
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,000
You think an old geezer like me

147
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,750
can defend the entirety of this huge villa?

148
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,000
What do you think I’m relying on?

149
00:08:35,017 --> 00:08:36,434
What do I think you're relying on?

150
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,250
You, shut up!

151
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,250
That wasn't a real question!

152
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,750
But… Rope of Divinity

153
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,250
It will also drain your Qi…

154
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,750
It’ll stop working immediately once you let go

155
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,750
Release her, now!

156
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,000
Release me first;

157
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
only then will I consider it.

158

Solid as Gold: Seven Day Lock - This move of mine…

159
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,250
I must stay locked for seven days before I can let go

160
00:08:55,431 --> 00:08:56,250
Who the hell thought of

161
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,000
such a boring move?

162
00:09:00,014 --> 00:09:02,014
So that's the situation.

163
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:05,014
So that's the situation!

164
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,250
On the one hand, we’ve got Dachun and Thirteen’s sister,

165
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,221
For sure I'm going to be on their side!

166
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,750
But I can’t just go and beat up her Mr. Majordomo…

167
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,500
cause we’re going to live altogether in the near future.

168
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,250
Then you just sneak over there,

169
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,500
cut the rope, and it’ll all be fine.

170
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay!

171
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,250
You know, the weather’s so cold up here…

172
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,750
So why’s everyone wearing clothes

173
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,250
like they’re still on Chicken Island?

174
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,750
Qi Controlled Scissors!

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,750
I Cut!

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Give it up!

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,250
Once you’re tied up,

178
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,250
You can’t do anything

179
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,500
It’s up to you, Dai Bo!

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,750
Such strong qi!

181
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The owner’s back.

182
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,000
How could he sense it before I did?

183
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,500
What good weather!

184
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:49,042
Subs by oofvegetable (and translators in our awesome Discord server :D)

185
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,250
Waiting… will tomorrow be a sunny day?

186
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,000
Waiting for yesterday, I’m no longer afraid of those memories

187
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,000
I miss u

188
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,750
Scattered with dark emotions

189
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,750
The you in my memories

190
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,750
Decided to go on a trip on your own

191
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,750
Insisted on going on the trip alone
decided to go on a trip on your own

192
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,750
Meet

193
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,000
It’s not even in summer

194
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,250
Good weather where the sun shines through…

195
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,250
like we’re destined to part ways

196
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:45,750
The “you” I’m missing

197
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,250
full of the warmth of positive emotions

198
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,250
The “you” I’m missing

199
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,500
Wishes that you will end your travels
wishes that you will end your travels

200
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,000
Let’s meet again

201
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,500
even if the weather is bad

202
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,750
and we don’t need to fuss over things again…

203
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,250
Who needs to separate from each other? :D
