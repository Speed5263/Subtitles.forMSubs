1
00:01:06,152 --> 00:01:07,902
Forever obey the leader

2
00:01:21,402 --> 00:01:22,652
These trash…

3
00:01:22,902 --> 00:01:25,652
It’s been so long and you all still haven’t caught Green Phoenix’s apprentice.

4
00:01:26,652 --> 00:01:27,902
The longer she lives on,

5
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:30,402
the more my unease grows.

6
00:01:31,402 --> 00:01:33,652
You, go out and spread the news for me.

7
00:01:34,152 --> 00:01:35,152
Green Phoenix…

8
00:01:35,152 --> 00:01:37,652
is being kept captive in Crocodile Valley of Blackrock Mountain.

9
00:01:39,152 --> 00:01:39,652
Yes, sir!

10
00:01:42,152 --> 00:01:44,152
You all should know what to do.

11
00:01:45,152 --> 00:01:46,652
We will set up a webbing trap to capture her,

12
00:01:46,652 --> 00:01:47,652
we won't ever fail!

13
00:01:48,902 --> 00:01:50,152
My injury

14
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:51,652
has almost fully healed by now.

15
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,652
It’s just that… I’m still not fully ready to lay down my heart.

16
00:01:54,652 --> 00:01:57,152
I’ve arranged for someone to come with you.

17
00:02:01,152 --> 00:02:03,402
He’s the newest member of the Shadow Killers.

18
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:05,152
Killer number: Nine.

19
00:02:17,902 --> 00:02:19,902
Actually, I can handle it by myself.

20
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:22,652
What if that guy

21
00:02:22,652 --> 00:02:24,652
has already recouped all of his powers?

22
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:26,902
Would you still be able to defeat him?

23
00:02:28,652 --> 00:02:29,652
You mean killer number Seven?

24
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,652
“That” was nothing but a failed experiment.

25
00:02:37,902 --> 00:02:38,402
Is his blade

26
00:02:39,402 --> 00:02:40,152
as quick as mine?

27
00:02:46,652 --> 00:02:47,902
I’m just kidding!

28
00:02:48,152 --> 00:02:49,152
There’s no need to be so serious.

29
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:51,652
I don’t like this guy.

30
00:02:52,402 --> 00:02:53,652
I don’t either.

31
00:02:54,293 --> 00:03:04,302
Bro got that "fire in the hole" ahh in him

32
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:27,902
Wait a second.

33
00:03:28,402 --> 00:03:29,652
Why am I being locked up?

34
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:32,152
Because we trespassed onto private property

35
00:03:32,652 --> 00:03:33,902
and attacked their housekeeper.

36
00:03:34,402 --> 00:03:35,652
You were the one who attacked him!

37
00:03:35,902 --> 00:03:37,402
I brought a fruit basket and a chicken!

38
00:03:37,902 --> 00:03:38,652
I even knocked on the door!

39
00:03:39,902 --> 00:03:40,902
False accusation!!!

40
00:03:40,902 --> 00:03:42,152
Let me out!!!

41
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:44,152
Otherwise, I’ll pee here wherever I—

42
00:03:52,152 --> 00:03:55,902
Any louder and I’ll cut your tongue off and serve it with a cup of wine!

43
00:03:57,902 --> 00:03:59,902
But the doctor told me my body is overtly “humid,” not to mention that my tongue has a thickly white coating…

44
00:04:00,402 --> 00:04:01,652
Tongues don’t taste very good!
(Ox tongue does taste really good, it's chewy and got a mild, subdued meaty flavour since its pure muscle)

45
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:03,902
Nonsense.

46
00:04:04,402 --> 00:04:06,652
Living by the sea will obviously result in high body humidity levels.

47
00:04:07,902 --> 00:04:08,652
Is that so?

48
00:04:08,902 --> 00:04:10,652
I have a medicinal tea recipe that could help with that.

49
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:11,652
If you give me a pen,

50
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:12,652
I’ll write it down for you.

51
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,152
You two…

52
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,652
I didn’t expect you to also know about Chinese medicine.

53
00:04:14,902 --> 00:04:16,152
Why are you two so annoying?!

54
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:18,152
Indestructible Virgin Body!

55
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:23,152
I didn’t even say anything…

56
00:04:23,652 --> 00:04:24,902
Why shoot me?

57
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:29,652
Wait!

58
00:04:29,652 --> 00:04:31,152
I actually just have one tiny request.

59
00:04:33,902 --> 00:04:34,902
I just want to

60
00:04:34,902 --> 00:04:36,402
meet up with Plum Blossom Thirteen.

61
00:04:40,152 --> 00:04:41,152
NOT GONNA HAPPEN!!!

62
00:04:41,652 --> 00:04:42,402
YOU WANNA PICK UP GIRLS?

63
00:04:42,402 --> 00:04:43,402
Well, I won't let you! I’m enough to stop you from flirting with her!

64
00:04:43,402 --> 00:04:45,152
YOU’RE GONNA STAY SINGLE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!!!

65
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:04,152
He confiscated my scissors,

66
00:05:04,402 --> 00:05:05,402
but I still have another blade.

67
00:05:09,402 --> 00:05:10,152
Go, go!

68
00:05:10,152 --> 00:05:10,652
Go up!

69
00:05:23,152 --> 00:05:24,152
That old man

70
00:05:24,152 --> 00:05:25,652
never thought I would still—

71
00:05:46,652 --> 00:05:48,652
So, it’s you…

72
00:05:56,152 --> 00:05:57,152
Not him, not him.

73
00:05:57,402 --> 00:05:58,652
No, no you’ve got the wrong guy.

74
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,402
Then, take a look at this scene.

75
00:06:03,652 --> 00:06:05,652
Doesn’t it feel a bit familiar?

76
00:06:15,652 --> 00:06:18,402
I built this place to be exactly the same as it was back then.

77
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:20,652
All to figure out the answer to

78
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:21,902
why, back then,

79
00:06:21,902 --> 00:06:23,652
I failed.

80
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:27,152
But

81
00:06:28,402 --> 00:06:30,152
isn’t this sculpted a little too ugly, though?

82
00:06:30,152 --> 00:06:31,652
I’m not a professional sculptor!!

83
00:06:31,902 --> 00:06:32,402
Hold up,

84
00:06:32,402 --> 00:06:33,652
that’s not even the important point!!

85
00:06:34,402 --> 00:06:35,402
But from my memory,

86
00:06:35,402 --> 00:06:36,402
I don’t recall you at all.

87
00:06:37,652 --> 00:06:38,652
Well, do you recall a

88
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:40,402
suave and personable young man in there?

89
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:47,652
I do indeed recall a handsome guy,

90
00:06:48,152 --> 00:06:49,402
but what connection could you have to him?

91
00:06:50,902 --> 00:06:52,402
He’s me!

92
00:06:53,152 --> 00:06:54,152
In the past,

93
00:06:54,152 --> 00:06:57,152
I used to be a man of equal beauty and wisdom who captured people with nets.

94
00:06:58,152 --> 00:06:59,402
I collected money from people

95
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:00,652
and captured them with my nets!

96
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:01,652
Never have I failed!

97
00:07:02,152 --> 00:07:02,902
I was known as:

98
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:05,652
Divine looks, worthy of the Rope of Divinity!

99
00:07:06,652 --> 00:07:07,652
I understand!

100
00:07:07,902 --> 00:07:08,902
But anyways, for now, you’re

101
00:07:08,902 --> 00:07:10,402
Plum Blossom Villa’s

102
00:07:10,402 --> 00:07:11,652
Mr. Anti-theft security net!

103
00:07:12,402 --> 00:07:13,902
I’m the great Mr. Majordomo here…

104
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:15,152
Don’t interrupt!

105
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:15,902
I’m not done speaking!

106
00:07:17,402 --> 00:07:18,152
Two years ago,

107
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:21,652
I constructed what I thought was the most perfect net trap I had ever made.

108
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:23,902
But that fish

109
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,652
still broke out of it.

110
00:07:27,152 --> 00:07:29,402
That was the one and only time I failed.

111
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:32,902
In this line of work,

112
00:07:32,902 --> 00:07:34,152
one failure

113
00:07:34,902 --> 00:07:36,402
and your present facade must disappear off the face of the Earth

114
00:07:36,902 --> 00:07:38,152
to avoid retribution.

115
00:07:38,652 --> 00:07:39,652
Your own failure

116
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:40,652
shouldn’t be blamed on others!

117
00:07:41,902 --> 00:07:43,652
If it wasn’t for him

118
00:07:43,652 --> 00:07:44,902
escaping from the net

119
00:07:45,902 --> 00:07:48,152
and remembering my face,

120
00:07:48,652 --> 00:07:50,402
then I wouldn’t have needed plastic surgery.

121
00:07:50,402 --> 00:07:53,152
I changed my body shape,
and changed my voice.

122
00:07:55,652 --> 00:07:56,652
But plastic surgery

123
00:07:56,652 --> 00:07:58,652
doesn’t necessarily have to make you look uglier.

124
00:07:59,402 --> 00:08:00,152
I DON’T CARE!!!

125
00:08:00,652 --> 00:08:01,902
I MUST ONCE MORE

126
00:08:01,902 --> 00:08:04,402
CHALLENGE YOU!!!

127
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:08,402
You scared me!

128
00:08:08,402 --> 00:08:10,402
I thought you wanted my handsome face

129
00:08:11,652 --> 00:08:13,402
Who the hell want such an ugly face?

130
00:08:13,652 --> 00:08:14,902
Let me lay down the rules!

131
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:18,402
Why is it me again?

132
00:08:19,152 --> 00:08:20,402
The rules are very simple:

133
00:08:20,902 --> 00:08:22,152
you just need to save this chicken,

134
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:23,652
get to the exit

135
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:24,902
and you win.

136
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:26,402
However,

137
00:08:26,652 --> 00:08:28,152
if you get caught in my Rope of Divinity,

138
00:08:28,652 --> 00:08:29,152
then it counts as a loss for you!

139
00:08:29,652 --> 00:08:31,152
If you touch that corporeal beast,

140
00:08:31,402 --> 00:08:32,652
you’ll also be electrocuted to death.

141
00:08:33,152 --> 00:08:34,152
If you win,

142
00:08:34,652 --> 00:08:36,652
I’ll even let that potato go.

143
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:38,902
Potato? Where?

144
00:08:45,402 --> 00:08:47,152
But if I win,

145
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,152
then the knot in my heart will untie.

146
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:50,652
And this place

147
00:08:50,652 --> 00:08:52,402
will have no need to exist.

148
00:08:53,152 --> 00:08:54,902
And all of you here will

149
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:57,402
disappear along with it.

150
00:09:53,402 --> 00:09:54,652
Dai Bo!!

151
00:09:54,652 --> 00:09:56,652
Seven!!

152
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:02,402
I forgot to tell you just now

153
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:03,652
I swapped out your blade.

154
00:10:03,652 --> 00:10:05,152
I wanted you to use it less, you know.

155
00:11:00,402 --> 00:11:02,152
It’s exactly the same as before, as expected!

156
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:11,902
I’VE CAUGHT YOU!!!

157
00:11:12,902 --> 00:11:13,402
X

158
00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:37,902
X

159
00:11:39,902 --> 00:11:40,402
Goodbye.

160
00:12:02,652 --> 00:12:04,402
I failed again.

161
00:12:06,652 --> 00:12:08,152
No matter how many tries

162
00:12:08,152 --> 00:12:09,652
would it still end in failure?

163
00:12:19,152 --> 00:12:20,402
But he seems

164
00:12:20,402 --> 00:12:21,902
so much weaker than before.

165
00:12:21,902 --> 00:12:22,902
Hey, I’m not free yet.

166
00:12:22,902 --> 00:12:23,402
Get lost!

167
00:12:24,152 --> 00:12:26,152
Why did I still lose…

168
00:12:27,902 --> 00:12:29,402
Help untie a bit of the rope

169
00:12:36,652 --> 00:12:38,152
The one you want to bind is my past self.

170
00:12:39,152 --> 00:12:39,902
Forget about him.

171
00:12:41,902 --> 00:12:42,902
It’s all in the past.

172
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:54,152
It’s all…

173
00:12:54,152 --> 00:12:55,652
in the past…?

174
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:58,902
You’re no longer a capture net.

175
00:12:59,652 --> 00:13:01,402
You’re Plum Blossom Villa’s premier housekeeper.

176
00:13:13,402 --> 00:13:15,152
Thirteen’s already gone.

177
00:13:16,152 --> 00:13:17,652
I don’t know where she went either.

178
00:13:18,652 --> 00:13:19,902
She’s been like this since she was a kid.

179
00:13:20,652 --> 00:13:21,402
So stubborn.

180
00:13:22,152 --> 00:13:22,902
Always eager to get ahead,

181
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:24,902
even when she clearly needs help

182
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:26,402
She doesn’t know how to ask for it, either.

183
00:13:26,902 --> 00:13:27,402
No problem.

184
00:13:27,902 --> 00:13:28,652
I’ll be able to find her.

185
00:13:35,152 --> 00:13:37,152
See you later!

186
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,152
I failed my mission to protect you again.

187
00:13:41,402 --> 00:13:42,652
Full refund.

188
00:13:43,402 --> 00:13:44,152
I apologize!

189
00:13:45,402 --> 00:13:47,652
But I don’t want your refund.

190
00:13:48,152 --> 00:13:50,152
I only wanted to get my own stuff back.

191
00:13:51,402 --> 00:13:52,902
Then, let’s try again.

192
00:13:52,902 --> 00:13:54,902
Why don’t you even ask me

193
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:56,402
what I’m going to fetch?

194
00:13:57,152 --> 00:13:57,652
What are you getting?

195
00:13:58,402 --> 00:13:59,152
Forget it.

196
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:01,902
It’s something from past times, after all.

197
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:03,652
It’s the people in front of me

198
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:05,402
that are alive and well that are far more important.

199
00:14:06,652 --> 00:14:07,902
I don’t see anyone in front of us.

200
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:10,152
The people in front of us,

201
00:14:10,402 --> 00:14:11,152
where are they?

202
00:14:13,902 --> 00:14:14,402
Where’d she go?

203
00:14:15,652 --> 00:14:16,652
How did you fall down there?

204
00:14:26,902 --> 00:14:28,902
Today is yet another

205
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:32,402
粘粘阳光的新早晨
new morning with bits of sunlight

206
00:14:33,902 --> 00:14:36,902
Friends! Who’s still deep in their dreams?

207
00:14:37,152 --> 00:14:40,152
Lazy bums! Why aren’t you awake?

208
00:14:40,402 --> 00:14:44,902
Today, I got to change into a suave looking T-shirt too

209
00:14:44,902 --> 00:14:46,152
I’m going out with full spirit

210
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:46,652
I’m going out with full spirit

211
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:50,152
Riding my humble motocompo

212
00:14:50,652 --> 00:14:53,652
taking a slow drive around my community

213
00:14:53,902 --> 00:14:56,902
The bad tempers of yesterday

214
00:14:56,902 --> 00:14:59,902
let me tell you about it all

215
00:15:00,652 --> 00:15:03,402
All those troubles

216
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,152
will be forgotten today

217
00:15:07,152 --> 00:15:10,152
I want them to accumulate in me, no more

218
00:15:10,402 --> 00:15:13,402
the secrets of summer

219
00:15:13,902 --> 00:15:18,402
Occasionally, the aroma of Durian breezes by my nose

220
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:23,402
Kitten, let’s play!

221
00:15:23,902 --> 00:15:26,902
Happy emotions

222
00:15:27,152 --> 00:15:30,152
encircles the community

223
00:15:30,402 --> 00:15:34,402
There’s something new everyday

224
00:15:37,152 --> 00:15:40,152
Happy emotions

225
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:43,402
surrounds the community

226
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:46,652
There’s something new everyday

227
00:15:46,652 --> 00:15:48,402
We got it every year

228
00:15:48,402 --> 00:15:52,152
Fresh new uploads

229
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:05,652
Finally found you

230
00:16:06,902 --> 00:16:09,152
You think you can hide in here for a long time?

231
00:16:10,902 --> 00:16:12,152
If you want us to fight,

232
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:13,652
we got to change places.

233
00:16:15,652 --> 00:16:17,152
The place can be any of your liking.

234
00:16:17,402 --> 00:16:19,652
I will never lose to you for the second time!

235
00:16:21,902 --> 00:16:22,902
Seven, he's playing serious this time!

236
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:25,902
Everyone, come and watch the ensuing battle here!
